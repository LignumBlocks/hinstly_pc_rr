A financial hack is a practical strategy or technique that helps individuals optimize their finances, save money, increase income, or improve their overall economic situation. Hacks range from easily accessible tips to sophisticated strategies used by high-net-worth individuals.

When scanning content, prioritize hacks that meet the following criteria:

- Clear Financial Value: Must demonstrate measurable financial benefits such as savings, income increases, or tax optimization with impact ranging from minor to significant.
- Originality: Exclude common hacks or widely known financial advice. The hack must offer something unique or little-known.
- Applicability: Must be implementable by users, specifying who can use it and under what conditions (e.g., income level, country).
- Legality and Risks: Must comply with legal standards, highlighting legal implications, tax loopholes, and ethical issues. Key terms: legal complexities, tax exemptions, offshore jurisdictions.
- Clear Explanation: Prioritize hacks offering detailed explanations, preferably in tutorial or step-by-step format.
- Temporal Relevance: Must be suitable for the current economic context. Look for mentions of temporality or economic conditions in which the hack works. Key phrases: "relevant now," "applicable in [current year]," "long-term/short-term strategy".
- Impact Verification: Look for indications of measurable financial impact: specific figures or expected results.
