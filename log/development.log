Brock\n\nReviewed by\nThomas J. Brock\n\nThomas J. Brock is a CFA and CPA with more than 20 years of experience in various areas including investing, insurance portfolio management, finance and accounting, personal investment and financial planning advice, and development of educational materials about life insurance and annuities.\n\nlearn about our financial review board\n\nFact checked by\nVikki Velasquez\n\nPhoto: \nEnis Aksoy / Getty Images\n\nMany of us struggle with the urge to seek perfection in various aspects of our lives. Who doesn’t want to have the best career in a profession they are passionate about or achieve a perfect state of work-life balance? The problem with ideals is that perfection itself can be elusive and is often just an illusion created in our minds.\n\nEven the best-laid plans frequently go awry, but that shouldn’t stop us from planning. In fact, a solid financial plan is capable of incorporating as many of life’s “what ifs” as possible and helps people adapt to change.\n\nNo matter how difficult it may be to achieve perfection in our planning, there are still some important things we can do to avoid making big mistakes. Here are a few examples of financial choices that you could spend decades trying to recover from: \n\n  Trying to Float Through Life Without a Budget  \n\nThe term “budgeting” often leads to frustration and unrealistic expectations. So, let’s give the budgeting process a more empowering name—it’s a “personal spending plan.” A personal spending plan provides awareness of where our money is going and helps us prioritize financial decisions. Budgeting is not just for those who are struggling to make ends meet. Everyone needs a personal spending plan, and yours needs to be more than just a loosely defined set of good intentions—your plan should always be written down. Fortunately, these spending plans do not need to be perfect or overly complex. Yours can be as simple or complicated as you want it to be. Remember to try and make saving money, paying bills, and paying off debt automatic.\n\n  Using Credit Cards to Pay for Wants and Needs  \n\nDebt becomes a major obstacle on the path to important goals like retirement. Credit card balances can pile up in a hurry, and stress will continue to increase with that debt. If you routinely carry a balance on your credit card, these lifestyle choices could end up costing you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars over time. Knowing that you have a tendency to spend more when you use plastic, compared to simply paying with cash, is another reason to change those credit card habits.\n\nIt is important to understand that credit cards are not necessarily a bad thing—especially if you have the discipline to pay them off in full each month. For those who do, capturing credit card rewards—such as cashback offers and travel perks—can be advantageous.\n\nOne effective way to help make sure that you’re not using credit cards the wrong way is to create a 24-hour rule for your credit card purchases. Always try to avoid using credit in situations where you are not able to pay off your balance full within 24 hours. If you consistently find yourself unable to follow this policy, it may be time to cut up those cards (or freeze them in a block of ice).\n\n  Falling for the Newer, Bigger, Better Trap   \n\nEvery single day, we are inundated with marketing messages and subtle hints that we deserve the next “big” thing. Whether it is a new car, real estate, technology gadget, dream vacation, wedding, or home improvement project, it is easy to fall into the trap.\n\nBuying a new car that you cannot afford is a common problem that plagues households throughout the Land of the Free. To avoid falling into this trap, you can go ahead and work any potential major purchases into your spending plan. Don’t just focus on the monthly payments. Take a look at other financial priorities to ensure that you are on solid financial ground and can afford the purchase without compromising your financial future.\n\n  Taking on Too Much Student Loan Debt  \n\nStudent loan debt in America has grown to $1.73 trillion as of 2021. This is proof that change is needed on both a personal and institutional level to control education costs and improve the value of college degrees. It’s too late to go back now if you’re already swimming in an ocean of student loan debt, but if you are contemplating pursuing academic endeavors or have a child nearing college, create a financial plan prior to taking on student loan debt so you know what you’re getting into.\n\n  Not Doing Enough to Protect Your Wealth  \n\nWhen it comes to insurance planning, we usually start with protecting our cars, homes, and personal assets. That normally doesn’t go far enough, as many people lack umbrella liability coverage, an affordable policy that covers any potential liabilities that exceed your regular coverage amounts.\n\nIt’s also important to think about those often-taboo subjects of death and disability. Regardless of age or whether or not you are married or have kids, make sure you have adequate life insurance coverage by running a basic analysis at least once every two or three years. If you were to have an accident or illness that would cause you to miss work for an extended period of time, would you and your family be alright?\n\n  Thinking That Retirement Planning Is Just for Old People  \n\nWaiting too late to begin saving for retirement is a big mistake. It is often difficult to begin our careers with the end in mind, especially when life is throwing countless challenges at us that complicate how we manage our day-to-day finances. So, maybe it’s time to re-frame the discussion and call it what it really is—Financial Independence Day.\n\n  Not Paying Attention to Fees on Financial Products  \n\nThe financial services industry hasn’t always been as transparent as necessary regarding the true costs of investment and insurance products. In fact, most people aren’t even aware of how different financial professionals are compensated or what the term &quot;fiduciary&quot; means.\n\nFinancial advisors can be an important source of knowledge and guidance in the wealth-building process. But that doesn’t mean you should blindly pay those fees, because they matter a lot more than most people realize. Improved awareness of the fees you are paying in various financial products can help you keep more of your hard-earned money.\n\n  Financial Avoidance  \n\nIf you want to align your most important life goals with your money and other resources, you have to pay attention to it. You don’t have to be a financial genius, you just need to take action and do something. For couples, financial avoidance has potentially devastating consequences such as money arguments and stress. As Liz Davidson points out in her book What Your Financial Advisor Isn’t Telling You, your life partner may be your worst financial enemy. Not talking to your spouse about financial matters has many risks. If you have a financial partner, you can talk about your financial goals during regular money talks. If you’re riding solo on this financial journey, seek out professional guidance, or share your goals with a trusted friend or coach so you have some accountability and encouragement.\n\nAs you can see, there are many financial decisions that can throw our retirement plans off track and hurt our chances of achieving other important life goals. A written financial plan is a helpful tool to help you avoid big mistakes.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nTell us why!\n\nOther\n\nSubmit\n\nSources\n\nThe Balance uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Often, we equate how well we’re doing financially with how much money we make, our credit score, or overall net worth. In reality, your financial well-being is determined by factors that tell a larger story about your relationship to money. This includes how well you’re able to stay on top of your financial obligations, how secure you feel about your financial future, and ultimately whether you have the freedom to make financial choices that allow you to enjoy your life.\n\nThe story you tell about your finances doesn’t need to be a scary one. This October, during Financial Planning Month, we’ve pulled together 25 easy-to-follow tips for getting a handle on your money and improving your overall financial well-being. It starts with getting a realistic picture of where your money is coming from and where it’s going. Then, we walk you through how to stay on top of your finances so you can plan—and save—for the future. \n\nHow would you rate your financial well-being? Get started by taking our quiz, and join us online throughout October by following #FinancialPlanningMonth and sharing these tips and tools.\n\nUnderstand where your money goes \n\nThe prequel to your financial story begins with a look into your past and current finances. What do you spend money on, and where are you getting your income? By tracking these factors, you can get a better sense of your financial picture today so you can plan for the future.\n\n1. Take our quiz to see how healthy your finances are.\n\nAnswer just 10 questions to measure your financial well-being and get a few steps for making improvements. Take it now, then take it again later to see if your story has changed.\n\n2. Learn where your money is coming from.\n\nBefore you can make any improvements, you need to get an accurate picture of your finances. Start by tracking your sources of income.\n\n3. Learn where your money is going.\n\nFill out our spending tracker to get a sense of your regular expenses. To get a handle on your money, you need a system that will allow you to track your daily spending on an ongoing basis. Find and stick to a system that works best for you.\n\n4. Write your bill due dates on a calendar.\n\nIf you have trouble making ends meet at the end of the month, the timing of your income and expenses may be off. It’s often helpful to see the full picture. Write down the due dates for your bills on a printed calendar that you can look at regularly as you plan for the weeks ahead.\n\nSmall changes can make a big difference\n\nThere are some easy steps you can take to turn the corner on your finances. Once you have an accurate picture of your money, follow these tips to start aligning your expenses to your income. \n\n5. Create a working budget that matches your cash flow.\n\nYour cash flow is the timing of when money comes in and when it goes out. Looking at it on a week-by-week basis, especially if you tend to run short, can help you create a working monthly budget .\n\n6. Request due dates for your bills that help you stay on track.\n\nIf there are certain weeks when money is especially tight, you can contact your creditors and utility companies and request new due dates that better align with your income .\n\n7. Compare your spending month-to-month.\n\nTrack your spending closely for several months. By looking at your spending in real-time and comparing it to the previous month , you’ll start to see places where you can make adjustments and move money into savings.\n\nSave for emergencies\n\nSaving money might feel out of reach at times, but consistently putting away even small amounts of money can make a big impact over time. Check out our tips for making saving a part of your everyday routine, and then watch it grow. \n\n8. Give yourself financial security with an emergency savings fund.\n\nStart by putting aside what you can afford in order to help cover many common emergencies, such as a car repair or medical bill, that could otherwise become costly debt. Prioritize a dedicated savings account for these unexpected expenses as one of your top savings goals, and as you get a better handle on your overall financial situation, you may decide to set more aside.\n\n9. Set rules for your emergency savings–but don’t be afraid to use it.\n\nSet guidelines for yourself for when you can spend down this savings fund and what constitutes an emergency, but if you need it, don’t be afraid to use it. That’s what it’s there for. Just remember to work to rebuild it.\n\n10. Make saving easy by making it automatic.\n\nWhether it’s through your bank or employer, there are a number of ways to have money automatically transferred into your savings every week or month. Reoccurring transfers are considered one of the most effective ways to build your savings.\n\n11. Put extra money into savings at times when you have it.\n\nThere may be weeks when money is tighter than others. Take the opportunity to put money into savings when you have it.\n\n12. Use your tax refund to help you reach financial goals.\n\nFor many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. Make a plan now to dedicate a portion of that money to saving for some of your larger financial or savings goals.\n\nReduce your debt \n\nPaying down debt can seem scary or tough, but with some proven strategies, you can make it happen, bit by bit. Our tips for reducing debt can help you find the right methods to trim your debt into something that feels manageable.\n\n13. Before making a plan to pay down your debts, know what you owe.\n\nUse our debt log  to get a sense of the amount of debt you owe, including interest rate and projected payoff date, and who you owe it to.\n\n14. Choose a debt reduction strategy that works best for you.\n\nThere are two common strategies to pay down your debt: the highest interest-rate method and the snowball method. Learn the differences and pick the one that works best for you.\n\n15. Learn about federal and private student loans repayment options.\n\nWhether you have federal or private student loans, or a mix of the two, start with the loans you’re most concerned with, and learn how to optimize paying them off.\n\n16. In the market for a car? Negotiating can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.\n\nPlan ahead, and learn what’s negotiable.\n\nCreate better money habits \n\nImproving how you manage your money on a daily basis may take time and dedication, but as you develop better money habits, you’ll create a financial story that you’re proud of. \n\n17. Apply only for credit you need.\n\nWhile it’s not the only factor, a good credit score is key to your financial well-being. One way to get and keep a good credit score is to apply only for credit you need.\n\n18. Set an annual reminder to check your credit reports.\n\nYou’re entitled to free credit reports every 12 months, so set up an annual reminder to review them for any errors that may be hurting your credit and should be fixed.\n\n19. Set up alerts to stay on top of your checking account balance.\n\nThrough most banks and credit unions, you’re able to set up alerts to notify you of your checking account balance at the end of the week or if your balance gets low. This helps you monitor your accounts and also protects you from incurring additional overdraft fees.\n\n20. If you can’t make a bill payment, act fast and call your creditors.\n\nMissing a bill payment can have several negative financial impacts. If you’re experiencing a financial emergency, contact your lenders or creditors before your due date to see what options may be available to you.\n\n21. When shopping for a loan, get quotes from at least three lenders.\n\nOne of the best ways to save money on a loan is to shop around and get estimates from several lenders to best compare terms and fees. This is true for home loans as well as other types of loans, including auto loans.\n\nPlan for success\n\nPlanning ahead is always helpful, and once you get a handle on your current financial picture, set some goals for what comes next. By building a plan, you have a roadmap to help guide you through the rest of your story. \n\n22. When planning for the future, set SMART financial goals.\n\nBreak down your financial goals  so that they’re Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. While dreams tend to be aspirational and often vague, setting actionable SMART goals can help you reach your dreams.\n\n23. Set up a 529 savings plan for your children.\n\nIf you have young children, college may seem far off, but to help reduce their need for student loans, a 529 plan is an investment account where your money can grow tax-free.\n\n24. Make your savings consistent.\n\nPutting even a small amount into savings on a consistent basis is one of the best ways to get your savings to grow so you can meet your goals, small or large. Set your own personal savings rule to live by and make a plan on how to achieve it .\n\n25. Prepare for life events and large purchases by planning ahead.\n\nOnce you get a handle on your finances, you can start to map out life events and large purchases , so you can begin saving!\n\nIf you’ve taken some time to work through these tips, starting with our financial well-being quiz, we encourage you to go back and take it again at the end of October. Improving your financial health and well-being takes time, but the more you know, the more empowered you’ll be to make informed decisions that’ll improve your financial future.\n\n                Join the conversation.

Start with small goals”—the fourth and newest addition to the Your Money, Your Goals suite of financial empowerment tools. It provides eight tools to help you plan for short-term and long-term goals.\n\nThe tools help answer the following questions:\n\nWhat could saving make possible for me?\n\nWhere can I put my savings?\n\nHow can I plan to save?\n\nHow can I save more in my current situation?\n\nHow much can I save each month?\n\nHow can I manage cash flow better?\n\nHow can I save when I get a tax refund?\n\nHow can I prepare for unexpected expenses?\n\nThe booklet is meant to be used in conjunction with one-on-one financial counseling or coaching received through a case manager or other service provider, but it can also be used by individuals on their own as they think about how to start and keep saving. \n\nThis past February, we launched our Start Small, Save Up initiative with the goal of increasing people’s financial well-being by helping more people save for emergencies and realize their personal savings goals. \n\nThe initiative and the resources created for it, like this booklet, are grounded in the need for people to build savings to weather unexpected expenses. According to the Federal Reserve Board's 2019 Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making (SHED), 39 percent of American adults would not cover a $400 emergency expense out of their own liquid savings. Twenty-seven percent of respondents would cover it by selling something or borrowing money, and 12 percent could not cover the $400 expense at all.\n\nSo whether you want to put money aside for unexpected expenses or make a plan to save for your future goals, we have resources that can help.\n\nOrder free savings booklets  and start saving today. \n\nHow to start saving\n\nBuild a savings plan\n\nGrowing your savings requires a plan. Our create a savings plan  worksheet can help you create a plan by analyzing your expenses and finding areas to save. You may discover ways to cut costs by avoiding fees, reducing bills, and changing habits. \n\nMake savings automatic\n\nOne of the easiest ways to build savings is to set up an automatic deposit from your paycheck. You can ask your employer to split your paycheck into a checking and savings account via direct deposits. Many banks and credit unions make it easy for you to automatically transfer funds into various accounts on a regular basis. Emergency savings should ideally be placed in an easily accessible account at a bank or credit union that will not charge you taxes, maintenance, or early withdrawal fees. If you do not have a bank account, use our checklist for opening a new checking or savings account . \n\nBetter manage your cash flow\n\nEven when you’ve done everything you can to increase sources of income or cut spending to increase your savings, there might be a few more things you can do. If you feel like you’re juggling your bill due dates every month, you’re not alone. Bill payment due dates often don’t align with your paychecks. Often those living paycheck to paycheck have a cash flow problem. \n\nDid you know you can request to change your bill due dates? Use our request a change in your bill due date  worksheet to help you evaluate your bill schedule and see whether changing the dates your bills are due could help you better manage your day-to-day finances. You may also be able to negotiate splitting a monthly payment into two smaller payments. For example, if a $700 rent payment is due the first of the month, see if you can make a $350 payment on the 1st and the 15th. \n\nSave at tax time\n\nEveryone has unexpected expenses and emergencies—a car repair, the need to travel to help a sick family member, paying bills when you’ve had a cutback in hours or even lost your job. For many Americans, their tax refund represents the largest lump sum of money they will receive all year. To make it possible for people to save automatically, the IRS offers tax filers the opportunity to deposit their refund in up to three separate accounts directly. One of those accounts could be a savings account.

On behalf of all my colleagues, allow me to pay my respects to the traditional owners of these lands.  Also, my thanks to Alan Kirkland for his thoughtful introduction and to all of you for making me feel so much at home.  Over the years, I have spoken to many groups where we would debate who deserved the credit for having traveled the farthest to be present.  Never before have I been more certain of my qualifications to claim that particular prize!\n\nIt is encouraging to be here with so many people who share similar goals and ideals for our global society.  I am honored to be chosen to deliver the Ruby Hutchison Memorial lecture.  In meetings over the past few days, you have shed much light on our common challenges and aspirations.  I have also had the occasion to learn more about our namesake here today and her deep commitment to basic fairness for all consumers.  The historical arc of our countries may be different, the evolution of our societies may be different, the structure of our economies may be different, but one strong thread ties us all together.  That thread is the difficult, important, and humbling mission of establishing a financial marketplace that is responsible and sustainable for individual consumers, people who have come to depend on credit and other financial services to create opportunities for themselves and their families.\n\nAs a single mother of seven children, Ruby Hutchison was well aware of how vulnerable people can be to fraud and exploitation.  In an era when formal consumer protections hardly existed, she was determined to inform consumers about their rights.  She also found new and innovative ways to strengthen those rights.  Her determination to tell people about products, their value, and their safety led to the birth of CHOICE magazine in April 1960.\n\nAt around the same time, these issues were beginning to receive more attention in the United States also.  In March of 1962, John F. Kennedy addressed the Congress on the subject of identifying and protecting the common interest people share as consumers of goods and services.  In discussing a Consumer Bill of Rights, President Kennedy spoke of Americans but could just as easily have been speaking of Australians or any other group of people around the world when he observed that consumers, “by definition, include us all.  They are the largest economic group in the economy, affecting and affected by almost every public and private economic decision.  Two-thirds of all spending in the economy is by consumers.  But they are the only important group in the economy who are not effectively organized, whose views are often not heard.”  It is this Presidential address that we now commemorate by our annual celebration of World Consumer Rights Day.\n\nAs the years unfold, the time may come when we have our own chance to wade into the currents of history.  In my case, I have come to serve as the first Director of the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The Bureau was created by our Congress in the wake of the global financial crisis.  Before that, the authority to administer and enforce various federal consumer financial laws was scattered across seven federal agencies.  For each of these agencies, consumer financial protection was only one of its various responsibilities.  Consequently, no single agency was primarily focused on protecting the everyday users of financial products and services – and consumers paid the price when the financial crisis hit us all so hard.\n\nAll of that changed with the advent of the Consumer Bureau.  We are now the only agency in the United States government with the sole mission of protecting people in the consumer financial marketplace.  The rules we write apply to all providers of consumer financial services.  We also have the authority to supervise and enforce those rules, and the governing laws, with respect to the largest banks as well as nonbank financial firms such as mortgage lenders, payday lenders, and others.\n\nThe most important financial transactions in people’s lives come within our province.  Whether it is to pay their bills or finance larger investments in their futures, most people now use credit to help manage their affairs.  Credit cards give us quick access to money when we need it.  Student loans help us obtain a post-secondary education.  Mortgages make it possible to buy a home and spread the payments over many years.  In all of these areas and more, the Consumer Bureau was established to stand on the side of consumers and ensure they are treated fairly.  Since we opened our doors less than four years ago, we have been intent on making consumer financial markets work better and helping people improve their financial lives.\n\n***\n\nWith the provision of financial products and services, as with many things in life, it takes two to tango.  Every such transaction involves both a financial provider and a consumer.  If we want to raise the standard for how these financial markets actually work, it behooves us to consider what we may be able to do to foster improved behavior on both sides of the table.  We need to focus on what we can do to incentivize financial providers to engage in sounder lending and more responsible conduct.  We also need to consider how we can help individuals obtain and build the skills to make sustainable choices that serve their own life goals.\n\nIn thinking about these issues, I will be making an effort to respond directly to two suggestions you raised for my consideration in your invitation to deliver this speech.  One suggestion was to talk about whether regulators can change the culture of financial service providers to persuade them to put the interests of consumers at their center.  The other suggestion was to discuss the issue of communication with consumers, including financial literacy, rights, and protections.\n\n***\n\nBefore turning to those matters, however, it seems important to establish some perspective on the role of regulation at the outset.  Certainly part of the job here is to discern risks to consumers and protect them by minimizing those risks.  But then we run pretty quickly up against the tendency in any human organization to err on the side of seeking disproportionately to eliminate risk altogether, even at the expense of the objectives that are served by the underlying activity.  We see this tendency in the sporting world in teams that play not to lose rather than play to win.  We see it in legal calculations that tend to elevate the safety of inaction over even the most minimal perils of action.  And we see it in the regulatory world in an overcautious emphasis to maintain the status quo rather than allow for dynamic change that brings new uncertainties but is itself the essence of progress.\n\nThis is a natural human tendency, but it would be misguided here.  It reflects an instinctive view of regulation as a defensive and negative enterprise, as a pinched and crabbed attempt to smother the underlying vitality of market participants seeking to fulfill their own ends.  It can generate an orientation that is anti-market and even, in various ways, anti-consumer.  I have noticed a deep but somewhat understandable skepticism about the regulatory mindset – a belief that it is bound to be paternalistic, seeking to prescribe all the decisions that individuals should be at liberty to make for themselves.  That mindset would be destructive of human freedom, of human ingenuity and initiative.  It would disserve our mission, and it is most emphatically not the view held by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nInstead, we regard ourselves as pro-market and pro-consumer.  We want consumers to thrive.  And therefore we want responsible financial providers to be able to thrive also by serving them well.  So we begin from the basic premise that there is no reason for anyone – least of all those charged with protecting consumers – to decry the structure of the free-market economy in the abstract.  Adam Smith taught us how the invisible hand can lead firms to serve the interests of their customers.  These customers, as he also taught us, are those who choose to give their “custom” – meaning their customary business not only now, but for the foreseeable future – to those firms best able to satisfy their particular demands.  To adapt a phrase from a populist American politician from the era of our Great Depression – ironic in that he was a vehement critic of capitalism – the smooth operation of the free market can succeed in creating a system in which “Everyone is a king, but no one wears a crown.”\n\nIf you are initially inclined to doubt this, take a moment and think about what capitalism has meant over the past century for the average person in our so-called “Western” economies.  The cost of many products has fallen significantly over time, and the sophistication of machinery and technology now available to each of us would be utterly astonishing to our forebears.  For a short list, think of washing machines, clothes dryers, indoor plumbing, heating and cooling systems, stoves and ovens, automobiles, radio and television, personal computers, cellular telephones, tablets, music players, and a list that goes on for quite a while.  This is not to say that everything in our economy does operate smoothly – we are too familiar with stubborn poverty and still too close to the global financial crisis to believe that – but in the grand scheme of things, one group that has surely benefited over this lengthy period of history has been the broad consumer public.\n\nBy the same token, innovation and progress in the financial realm have had similar effects on the general population.  Credit that was virtually non-existent a hundred years ago is widespread today.  And credit means opportunity.  This is a very important truth to bear in mind here.  Credit entails risk, no doubt, and risk can lead to nasty results, but risk also promises reward and hence credit gives us something to work with – something that may allow us to make more of our lives tomorrow than we have yet attained today.  It may allow for investments such as the purchase of a home or a car.  It may allow for investments in human capital – loans for education or job training, for example.  It may give us some limited ability to make purchases to meet our needs today with money we do not expect will come until later.  The ability to time-shift the ways and means of our lives creates more convenience and flexibility in our daily affairs, all of which is beneficial for the average person.  And as for specific financial products, think of checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, debit cards, ATM machines, credit reporting, mortgage loans, car loans, on-line bill pay, direct deposit, money transfers, and on and on.  In the financial realm, also, a major beneficiary of all this progress has been the ordinary consumer.\n\nSo consumers can exert substantial power, both individually and collectively, within a well-functioning free-market economy.  People can be their own best consumer protectors as long as the market operates properly, without undue obstacles to their primary position as individual decision-makers who have what they need to make informed decisions.  But we also know that ideal world may not reflect our common experience, and we must strive toward its attainment.\n\nWith that context in mind, we can return to our two central questions:  First, how can regulators change the culture of financial service providers to persuade them to put the interests of consumers at their center?  Second, how can regulators (or others) help build financial capability by communicating effectively about financial literacy and protections so consumers can be in the best position to look out for their own interests?  What follows is a progress report on how we are treating each of these issues in the work we are doing at the Consumer Bureau.  No doubt there are other and better ideas people may have, either now or over time, about how to pursue these objectives.  And let me be the first to say that we are all ears, always, to hear people’s thoughts about different and more effective approaches.  I am not aware of any playbook that sets the rules for how we can optimally perform these tasks.  But we have begun to settle into our work, and certain strategies and themes are beginning to emerge from our experiences thus far.  So I appreciate your patience as I bend your ear for a bit.\n\n***\n\nChanging the culture of financial service providers – or any for-profit business enterprises – is a tall order.  In a free-market economy, the culture revolves around making money; and in an economy built around competing firms, the companies operate on behalf of their owners, which are the shareholders who own their corporate stock.  The incentives here are strong and compelling.  They are governed by a legal regime that creates a duty to maximize shareholder value and they are driven by the innate self-interest that motivates most human behavior.\n\nBut free markets are not simply untrammeled hubbubs of chaotic human activity.  Despite what we may seem to see on any trading floor, anarchy in the marketplace has never worked and never will work.  On the contrary, in more developed economies our markets operate within the broad confines of legal principle backed by legal compulsion.  If someone violates a contract, they can be sued to restore or repair the mutual obligations they had agreed upon.  If someone seizes the property of another, the law is available to decide whether they have acted wrongfully and, if so, to make them surrender what they have unjustly appropriated for themselves.  Even in a bare-bones “night watchman” state posited by a few theorists, free markets rest on the effective regulation of law and order imposed, at a minimum, by the common law and the criminal law.\n\nFor about the last century in America, and increasingly in many of the world’s more developed market economies, this skeletal outline has been filled in more completely by the additional apparatus of formal government regulation.  In the United States, a number of government agencies – including the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – play a role in ensuring that free markets also operate fairly, and that some of the disequilibria generated by no-holds-barred capitalism can be smoothed out to some degree.  As we saw with the meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market that played such a large role in the global financial crisis, any significant economic disequilibrium can create destructive externalities in the broader economy – in this case, massive job losses, widespread home foreclosures, and crushing reductions in retirement savings within the American economy and great instability transmitted to the world economy.\n\nAs we also have seen, though the economy inevitably seeks to return to some market-clearing equilibrium over time, the period of dislocation can be substantial.  We are now at six-and-a-half consecutive years of unprecedented levels of near-zero real interest rates in the U.S. economy, for instance, which is rivaling the length of the Great Depression in its severity.  As Lord Keynes once ruefully noted about the classical economists and their tidy equilibrium models, “in the long run, we are all dead.”  The existence of such real-world flaws undermines the neat graphs of the classical economic models and gives us reason to consider more substantive regulatory interventions that may help safeguard the smooth functioning of economic markets.\n\nIn short, not all dynamics of the market economy are driven by what is best for consumers – other influences are at work upon corporate behavior as well.  And if we focus most narrowly on what drives profit and innovation for providers, we must recognize that the long-term interest of the consumer public is not always compatible with the behavior we see in the short run.  In various market situations, the long-term interests of consumers and the short-run interests of providers can turn out to be oppositional, and much corporate ingenuity is channeled into various schemes to collect rents and exploit superior market positions.  It was Adam Smith, after all, who observed that “people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”  Notably, some economic innovations can harm consumers even as they may seem to benefit providers, at least for a time.  Exotic mortgage products of the last decade, for instance, were innovations that visited devastating harm on many borrowers – wiping out their savings, ruining their credit, and driving them into foreclosure and economic instability.  Yet these products and the shoddy underwriting that accompanied them were widely pursued and maintained for years, despite the risks that were apparent on their face.\n\nSo if our free-market economy is not always marked by happy levels of equilibrium that maximize consumer welfare, what kinds of influences may complicate the scene?  In addition to pressure from consumers, providers can be affected by other market actors – including competitors, suppliers, shareholders, and employees.  They also can be buffeted by pressures external to a particular market, such as exogenous shocks.\n\nOne area that deserves our attention is the effect of the law that regulates economic conduct.  That body of law can emanate from many sources – including legislators, judges, and various types of executive officials – and it can oscillate over time, even rather unpredictably.  Depending on how these influences play out, there can be many obstacles to economic markets mechanically promoting the best interests of consumers.  Accordingly, there can be opportunities to correct for market failures, imbalances, and distortions that are harmful to consumers.\n\nBut just how are we to unpack all of this?  And how should we, as regulators, go about trying to change the culture of financial service providers to focus them on the interests of consumers in face of the numerous pressures that may lead them to do otherwise?  Those are hard questions, especially in light of the humbling realization that the regulators are human beings themselves who lack omniscience.  But we have one key point as our compass, which is to put the voice of the consumer at the heart of our mission and make it the center of attention for financial providers as well.  So let me talk about four things we are doing to accomplish this goal.\n\n***\n\nIf our work is to be guided by the voice of the consumer, we must first take pains to hear that voice.  We do this most squarely through our consumer response function.  Congress required this new agency to establish a system for collecting, investigating, and responding to consumer complaints.  In carrying out this duty, we have created the opportunity to hear directly from consumers what is on their minds and what challenges and concerns they are facing in their everyday lives as they seek to navigate the consumer financial marketplace.\n\nThe project here is powerfully motivated by the economic self-interest of consumers themselves, who hope that by submitting a complaint they can achieve a resolution and perhaps redress of their grievance.  Once a consumer submits a complaint to the Bureau, we forward it via a secure web portal to the appropriate company, which reviews the information, communicates with the consumer as needed, and determines what action to take in response.  The company reports back to us and to the consumer on strict time frames.  We then invite the consumer to review the response and provide feedback.  We review the feedback, using this information along with any other information we may have to prioritize complaints for investigation.\n\nBehind each complaint lie the troubles of real people, the people behind the data.  They bring to life the true impact that consumer financial markets can have on individual lives and families.  To date, the Bureau has fielded over 550,000 complaints about a wide range of products and services, including mortgages, credit cards, student loans, auto loans, bank accounts and services, credit reporting, debt collection, payday loans, money transfers, prepaid cards, and other consumer loans.\n\nThrough this process alone, the Bureau has helped consumers secure millions of dollars in monetary relief and further satisfaction in the form of non-monetary relief, such as cleaning up their credit reports or fending off errant or harassing debt collectors, which can have ripple effects on people’s financial well-being as well as their peace of mind.  Moreover, specific complaints sometimes help us target consumers for timely and focused advice about how they might go about understanding and addressing those issues on their own.\n\nAs we analyze and aggregate complaints in different ways, they become more than just an issue for the particular consumer.  Evaluating the broader pattern of complaints enables us to identify potentially systemic issues and prioritize problems.  For example, hearing from students who cannot afford to repay their private student loans and are working two jobs to make ends meet can teach us more about the kinds of information students need before they take out those loans.  Or if older Americans tell us about problems with reverse mortgages, we can devote resources to exploring measures to address the problems they are describing.\n\nWe also offer our Consumer Complaint Database, which makes the underlying data available to the public to inform and affect the marketplace.  As we are hearing from hundreds of thousands of consumers at an increasing rate, this growing repository of information yields an ever-more-detailed impression of what is happening to consumers in real time in the marketplace.  This data can be helpful to industry and consumers alike in figuring out how to approach these issues.  We are well aware that not all, or even most, consumer protection comes from government agencies.  Market participants themselves are initially responsible for fundamental aspects of consumer protection including, for example, how a business decides to treat its customers and whether people are willing and able to stand up for themselves when they are mistreated.  With this in mind, the Bureau has made information about consumer complaints available to the public, with the ability to download the data, aggregate it in various ways, and filter it based on specific search criteria, such as by complaint type, company, zip code, date, or any other combination of available variables.\n\nWe believe the disclosure of this information is one of the best tools government agencies can use to improve the operation of the marketplace.  People across the spectrum can make their own judgments about it.  For financial companies, this data can help them detect and understand problems in the rest of the market and assess their performance against their peers, which is information they cannot access in any other way.  In fact, institutions have shown they want to minimize the number of complaints we receive about them and improve their handling of complaints.  Data can also help them detect and reduce regulatory, enforcement, and litigation risks.  And perhaps they can find things to tout in the data:  taking credit, for example, for having low complaint volumes or quick response times.\n\nFor consumers, the database can be a valued educational and shopping tool.  They can see how companies respond and draw their own conclusions.  Finally, anyone who wishes to do so can use the information to rate companies and products by evaluating what has been said about them in the aggregate, with opportunities for companies to respond with their own analysis.  These matters can be fought out in the marketplace of ideas, subject ultimately to the verdict rendered by the court of public opinion, which is just how economic marketplaces are designed to work.\n\n***\n\nOur second approach to affecting the behavior of financial providers lies in our compulsory work through our supervision and law enforcement tools to ensure compliance with federal consumer protection and fair lending laws.  Through examinations, we can look into every pertinent aspect of how a firm interacts with consumers and require specific changes to be made to come into compliance with the law, including avoiding or terminating unlawful practices that are unfair to consumers.  Redress to make consumers whole for past violations is also part of this process.\n\nOne notable aspect of the supervisory work we are doing is to create parity across competitors in each consumer financial market.  Previously, the regulatory structure had been partial and incomplete, with federal oversight limited to chartered institutions such as banks, thrifts, and credit unions for purely historical and accidental reasons.  Other financial companies competed against them but were not subject to the same level of scrutiny about their compliance efforts.  We are now taking necessary and important steps to level the playing field in these markets, which is essential for a rational regulatory structure to have the chance to succeed.\n\nWhere appropriate, we seek such changes through enforcement actions also, which we can pursue in court or through our own administrative proceedings.  In such actions, we can obtain injunctive relief as well as financial relief, including restitution or disgorgement for the benefit of consumers; we also impose civil penalties in cases as warranted by the defendant’s misconduct.  All of these actions are designed to enforce the consumer financial laws that Congress placed within our authority, including fair lending laws and the statutory prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.  Those laws are worth nothing if they cannot be made to stick, so this work is crucial to fulfilling our duty to ensure fair, transparent, and competitive markets.  Through combined supervisory and enforcement actions to date, we have made $5.3 billion in relief available to over 16 million consumers, and we have collected over $200 million in civil penalties.\n\nFrom this work, we have come to believe that evenhanded oversight is necessary to foster true competition and ensure that all consumers are treated fairly in the marketplace.  When honest and innovative businesses can succeed on the merits, it spurs their efforts to drive growth and progress.  Appropriate oversight and enforcement empowers consumers by ensuring that markets function transparently.  Upstanding businesses benefit the most when we hold accountable those that cheat their customers.  Within those boundaries, businesses can compete aggressively with one another; when they do, consumers reap the benefits through improved products and services.  Restoring both the perception and the reality of law and order also helps to establish trust in the marketplace for household credit and other financial services.  Consumers will be willing to offer their “custom” to providers on an ongoing basis when they feel confident and positive about the products and services they use and when they know themselves to be well served over time.\n\nThroughout the process, we are making it a point to place the voice of the consumer at the center of both our supervision and our enforcement work.  As we risk-scope examinations, we decide which companies and products to prioritize and we determine what exactly to look for at a given institution.  A key data source is our base of consumer complaints, supplemented by the results of our ongoing market monitoring, which draws on a wealth of data and experience.\n\nConsumer complaints also are an invaluable source of information to spur investigations that generate enforcement actions.  We are thus able to combine the richness of individual stories with the more authoritative significance that comes when we graduate from anecdote to data.  This occurs when we can see not just isolated complaints, but the patterns that are generated by comparing and contrasting hundreds or thousands of such consumer inputs over time.  And we likewise look to the same kinds of information generated by other agencies and officials.  In one instance – that of our enforcement actions against credit card companies for deceptive marketing of certain add-on products – we took some assurance from finding that similar practices had harmed consumers and led to extensive enforcement activity in other countries as well.\n\n***\n\nThe third way we are affecting the behavior of financial providers is through substantive regulation, where it is merited.  To some extent, our Congress has made some specific determinations about when we should use this tool.  Most notably, it expressly directed us to adopt sweeping new rules to root out some of the worst abuses in the mortgage market, either restricting or banning certain exotic products and practices that had harmed consumers and insisting on more robust levels of engagement between providers and consumers to avoid and mitigate such harm.  We have also undertaken or are considering substantive policy interventions on remittance transfers, prepaid cards and accounts, debt collection, and small-dollar loans (sometimes known as “payday loans”).  Where we can do so effectively, we are also looking to adopt regulations that improve disclosures around financial products and services.  Yet we do not think improved disclosure alone is necessarily an effective substitute for substantive regulation where the latter is justified on the facts as we understand them.\n\nIt is important for us to recognize that our power to effect specific change in the business of financial providers is at its zenith when we write new rules.  Here we are most clearly exercising quasi-legislative authority as delegated from Congress itself, and we must do so carefully, through deliberate and thoughtful processes.  We are obliged to be faithful to the authority actually delegated to us, to make reasonable and well-supported decisions within the range of the discretion conferred upon us, and to work through a public notice-and-comment process to ensure that we seek out and digest a broad range of input before finalizing our regulations.\n\nWe can, of course, always revisit our judgments if we find new information indicating that we may not have struck the right balance on our first try.  When we are convinced of the need, we have shown that we will not hesitate to put aside pride of authorship in our quest to “get it right” as best we can.  We have already adopted meaningful amendments to our initial regulation on remittance transfers to improve its practicality, for example, and we continue to respond to numerous suggestions by adjusting and modifying our rules governing the mortgage market.\n\nBut here too, the voice of the consumer is critical to prompting and shaping our efforts.  And we will take up that voice wherever we can find it.  Of course, we look to our database of consumer complaints as one very useful indicator of the need for such policy interventions.  We also closely scrutinize market and field intelligence, looking for developments that may help shape our strategic approach.  Consumers, of course, can speak directly to us, but they also speak more generally by their behavior in the marketplace.  And we attend closely to what we learn from financial providers themselves, both in direct discussions and by seeing how markets are changing over time.  Our regulatory judgments are further informed by what we glean from supervisory examinations and enforcement investigations about the evolving relationships between financial providers and consumers.  Once again, we agree here with Adam Smith, who wrote in The Wealth of Nations that “the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.”\n\n***\n\nIn addition, we have found that we can affect the behavior of financial providers by publishing information about consumer financial markets, including data showing how the markets operate and illuminating certain practices.  We frequently quote former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis – one of America’s original consumer advocates over a century ago – who famously said that “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.”  Through a great number of research reports, white papers, “Data Points,” bulletins, blogs, guidance documents, webinars, and virtually every form of written or oral communication that we can devise, we try to foster and advance public understanding of these issues that are so central to the well-being of individuals and families.\n\nOne of our goals is simply greater awareness of these issues, which may help affect the behavior of producers and consumers alike.  Another is to influence and engage other policymakers, who have their own authority to act in light of data thus assembled and analyzed.  To date, our reports and publications on reverse mortgages, student loans, mortgage origination, medical debt, credit reporting, credit scoring, and payday lending – to present what is not by any means an exhaustive list – has had visible effects on public policy at both the federal and state levels in our federalist system of government.  At times, our publications have called out questionable or disreputable practices, and the mere attention to such matters, once spread before the public and the media, tends to have salutary and desirable effects on market behavior.\n\nAt the same time, one of our guiding principles is to develop data that will shed more light on consumer financial markets and, to the extent we can, make it available to the public for others to see what we might have missed.  If this leads to insights by consumers themselves, advocates, academics, journalists, industry, and others, then so much the better.  Here too, international comparisons may be apt at times, and we draw your attention to our published reports, research, and discussions made available on our website at consumerfinance.gov.  We hope you will consider how any of this information might be put to use in new and innovative ways.  But then, please, do us the favor of telling us about it as well!\n\n***\n\nFinally, we come to the other question you had originally posed:  How can regulators (or others) empower consumers by communicating effectively with them about issues like financial literacy, rights, and protections so that they can be in the best position to look out for their own interests?  This is a subject of urgent interest across borders and cultures, for wherever there are consumers, they have difficulties managing the ways and means of their lives.\n\nAs we saw earlier, in most places we have certainly come a long way as consumers from the state of nature pessimistically described by Thomas Hobbes:  “and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”  But we all are keenly aware of our lack of comprehensive knowledge about these matters.  And more than that, we feel an incapacity at times to act on what we know by doing the right things – that is to say, the prudent or sensible things – that may be most compatible with our own self-interest, properly understood as projected over time.  Behavioral economists are developing and testing various theories about why consumers often fail to make sound choices that will be sustainable over the longer trajectory of their future lives.  We need to have an active conversation about financial choices and financial management, both to learn the best paths and to find ways to traverse them effectively.\n\nLet me be the first to say that we have not discovered any magic answers here.  Among the many challenges are the inconvenient facts that financial issues can be intricate and complex, that they may press on sensitive sore spots, that people often are embarrassed or ashamed to discuss them candidly, and that the busy occupations of life do not lend themselves to setting aside time for concentrated study of such matters, even if we knew where to go for such guidance.\n\nWe are committed to undertaking new research to learn more about how to proceed here, including our recent report on the topic of financial well-being, which I invite you to read.  But in the meantime, we are not content to wait while we study, and so we are acting on certain instincts in trying to reach consumers with appropriate and helpful information.  Let me describe our main projects and some of our thinking about them, in hopes of stimulating further ideas from you and others.\n\nTo begin with, we start from the recognition that consumer financial markets are difficult for people to navigate effectively.  One crucial task is to find ways to render this landscape more accessible to people if we possibly can.  The markets for consumer credit and household finance hold more potential than ever before, but they are also more complex than ever before.  And with complexity comes more risk of getting it wrong and being harmed.  When my parents were raising a family fifty years ago, the products and services available to them were more limited but also more straightforward.  Basic mortgages, a few in-store credit cards, and some limited consumer loans were about the extent of the offerings.  There was not much to be done with them, but it was not possible to get into too much trouble unless you tried pretty hard to do so.\n\nToday, the array of offerings is much broader and the actual mechanics can be harder to grasp.  On the front end, credit reporting and scoring have opened more horizons for tapping consumer credit markets, and on the back end the increased tools and resources available to debt collectors, along with computerized recordkeeping, may lengthen the damaging tail of credit failures.  Over the years, strenuous efforts to address consumer finance issues through detailed and extensive disclosures have had only partial success.  This approach has made it hard to distinguish what is important from what is unimportant.  Consumers may fail to understand the description of costs and risks and many simply avoid wading into the increasingly fine print altogether.\n\nOur main strategy for attacking these problems has been what we call our “Know Before You Owe” approach to various consumer financial products and services.  Essentially, it is a short-form approach to consumer disclosures, drawing on the concept of executive summaries found today at the front of most lengthy reports in almost any field.  By leveraging our expertise and consumer research to pull out the most essential points and help people focus on them, we are making it possible once again to see the forest for the trees.  This approach seeks to avoid failed decision-making, with consequent troubles and regrets.  After all, two basic premises of a well-functioning market are first, that buyers and sellers understand the terms of the deal, and second, that buyers are able to compare possible alternatives.\n\nWe have heard many such regrets from consumers describing decisions they made about their mortgages, home equity loans, student loans, and other credit products.  By streamlining disclosures and highlighting the key points about costs and risks, our new agency has joined in the lead set by our Congress to create simplified and more uniform disclosures for mortgages, credit cards, and student loans that also make it easier to compare the pros and cons of competing products.  We are also working on the same approach in our proposed regulations for prepaid cards.  So one way we are trying to communicate more effectively with consumers is by revising the kind of information they receive when they make decisions about obtaining financial products and services.  We believe this will help especially by making it easier for consumers to avoid the pitfalls and confusions of “back-end pricing,” where the apparent terms of the deal as presented up front do not match the ultimate terms when they are revealed, or perhaps as they have migrated, somewhere down the road.\n\nAnother way we are trying to communicate more effectively with consumers is by forging partnerships with those who already have developed substantial trust and expertise with certain segments of the public.  We are working with them to deliver content to consumers on financial issues as an integrated piece of the work they are already doing to deliver other services.  With social service providers, and now with labor unions, community volunteers, and legal services offices, we have been developing a toolkit we call “Your Money, Your Goals,” which provides training to address topics like budgeting daily expenses, managing debt, and avoiding financial tricks and traps.  We also are partnering with hundreds of library systems all over the country to train librarians, deliver content, and encourage sessions that bring in other partners such as credit counseling services.  These resources for addressing consumer financial issues are striking a chord with patrons who, we have found, are turning to their local libraries in growing numbers to deal with their personal economic issues.\n\nAn important and difficult issue in the United States is how to accomplish what everyone knows needs to be done, which is to communicate more effectively with young people in our schools through greater focus on financial education.  In our country, education operates primarily at the state and local level, which means that control over the classroom is not readily susceptible to centralized decision-making that can set the specifics of the curriculum.  A growing number of states are taking action to incorporate more financial education into the classroom.  But even in the wake of the global financial crisis, where many consumers were hurt badly by their lack of know-how in guarding against potential harm, progress here seems achingly slow.  We have published a report summarizing the best thinking in the area of K-12 financial education in the United States, with our recommendations.  But we are quite interested in efforts we see being made around the world, and we are aware that we may have much to learn from you and others about how we can better develop our young people into stronger and more capable consumers.\n\nAlthough I will not undertake to summarize all of the work we are doing here, one further way we are communicating with consumers is by developing resources to help people find the information they need, at the right time, to manage some of the challenges they are confronting.  Certain financial decisions are not everyday matters, but may arise only once or twice in a lifetime.  Almost by definition, we lack experience and expertise with such issues, which may nonetheless be some of the most significant and lasting decisions we will ever make.\n\nIn the United States, two such major decisions concern paying for college and buying a home.  With the U.S. Department of Education we created a “Financial Aid Shopping Sheet” to help students navigate the complex world of student loans; it allows students to compare financial aid packages and to understand the burdens they will face after graduation.  We have built around that resource to create a set of tools we call “Paying for College” to help people navigate this decision-making process from beginning to end.\n\nMore recently, we launched another set of resources that we call “Owning a Home,” which is an interactive, online toolkit designed to help consumers as they shop for a mortgage.  These tools are designed to give consumers the information and confidence they need to get the best deal.  Right now, we have made public the beta version of this resource, which will be enhanced and improved over the course of the year.\n\nAnother, broader resource is “Ask CFPB,” an online database that provides carefully considered answers to over a thousand questions we have been frequently asked by consumers.  The answers reflect the deep expertise of our colleagues, but are laid out in plain language to make them easy to understand.  They also are grouped by issue area, so that if a consumer encounters a new problem with a debt collector, for example, they can learn all about their rights and the issues that may be involved.  In this manner, we are seeking to help people engage in consumer self-protection, which is critical to their empowerment.  We continue to add more questions and refine the answers in response to suggestions and comments from the public – including, if you are willing, from you as well.\n\nFinally, we are communicating with consumers through specialty offices that home in on unique problems faced by certain categories of consumers.  We focus on students, older Americans, servicemembers, and those with low to moderate incomes who are often financially vulnerable.  This focus allows us to understand and address particular challenges that impede their financial success.  It also enables us to reach out more effectively to provide these populations with the resources that will help them deal with the same kinds of problems that confront consumers more generally.\n\nThose are some of the main examples of how we are seeking to communicate more effectively with consumers.  As we work to ensure that financial institutions are not designing or marketing products in ways that hurt consumers, we are also striving to put people in a position to make good choices for themselves, choices that enhance their lives and empower them to succeed.  People need better information about the costs and risks of borrowing.  They need to be able to comparison shop for a good deal.  They deserve the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the deal they were promised is the deal they are actually getting, not just tomorrow, but next month and next year as well.  It is not so easy for people to figure out where to go to find such answers from a neutral source.  Much of the information they may find on-line today is shaped by financial providers that are trying to sell a product or service, which may skew the advice they are giving.  It is quite important for our new agency to continue to build a reputation as a trusted, expert, neutral resource that can look out for consumers and help them look out for themselves.\n\n***\n\nI have spoken at length here tonight, and now I am almost done.  Obviously the project of affecting the behavior of financial providers and financial consumers poses enormous challenges.  We have seen all too clearly that if these products are predatory, or if they are misunderstood or misused, they can do real damage to people’s lives.  At the Consumer Bureau, we envision a financial marketplace where providers play by the rules and treat consumers fairly.  In addition, people need to make choices that fit their circumstances – nobody can do that for them – and take responsibility for the choices they make.  They should be able to have the confidence that comes from knowing that dangerous or abusive products and practices are being limited.  Through fair rules, consistent oversight, appropriate law enforcement, and broad consumer engagement, we are helping to restore trust in these markets, protect consumers from improper conduct, and ensure access to a fair, competitive, and transparent financial marketplace.\n\nThat is a worthy piece of work for anyone, anywhere.  As Albert Camus said in the Myth of Sisyphus, “The struggle itself . . . is enough to fill one’s heart.”  So let me close by saying that we look forward to working with you and the international community to improve people’s financial lives across the globe.  Together, we can perpetuate the steadfast spirit of Ruby Hutchison as we seek to fulfill our shared goals.  The people we serve are the ones who deserve that the most.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak here this morning at the John Glenn College of Public Affairs.  The opportunity is especially meaningful for me, since my first formal experience in public service was through an internship with Senator Glenn in the spring of 1980.  I was a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed college student, and I was grateful for the chance to see a bit of Washington up close.  I recall working up what I no doubt regarded as some very eloquent responses to constituent correspondence (which arrived by the bushels in Senator Glenn’s office, in particular).  I also recall being set loose to cover some interesting Senate hearings on farm policy and the future of the auto industry (though I could hardly have anticipated the travails would lie ahead for that important industry).  But most memorable of all was the occasion late in my internship when I had the opportunity to shadow the senator all through the day, seeing just what he saw and hearing just what he said and heard.  This brief exposure, and his powerful example, were inspiring to me then and are still inspiring to me now.\n\nIn that era, and perhaps now again in our own, an important and seemingly difficult question presented itself to young people like myself:  Why public service?  For I began to come of age, and pay attention to public affairs, only in the early ’70s.  What did I see?  First I saw a vice president of the United States who was forced to resign from office for his current and former crimes of corruption.  Soon after that I saw the president of the United States reluctantly resign in disgrace as he faced the growing likelihood of impeachment proceedings arising from the Watergate scandal.  During the same era, the country saw widespread activism and unrest, the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, the Vietnam crisis, and the shooting deaths of the Kent State students here in Ohio.  It was nobody’s finest hour – not the leaders, not the public, and not the country itself.  When I went off to college and began to think to myself and say to others that I was interested in government and even perhaps in politics, many level-headed friends of my family who cared deeply about me made it clear that they viewed my interest as quite ill-advised.\n\nOver the course of an enduring career in public service that now spans a quarter-century, I have often been asked where my interest in this chosen field may have developed.  What may be most surprising is that I have found myself groping over the years to answer that question for myself.  In one sense, I am quite aware that it has much to do with my parents and the example they set.  My father spent his entire career – 43½ years – working with the developmentally disabled, first as an aide and eventually as the program director of the largest residential center in Ohio.  He is now gracefully retired at age 97.  My mother, who passed away long ago when I was still in college, was a social worker and a teacher who also founded the first foster grandparent program for the developmentally disabled in Ohio – all of which partly explains how she met and won over that formerly confirmed bachelor.\n\nEven when we were very young, my brothers and I spent much time with the residents who were the objects of their care and affection.  I suppose today we might say, in a rather more “hifalutin” way, that we were volunteering or were engaged in community service.  At the time, though, we were just imbibing our parents’ example of true public service, showing through the steady persistence of unsung, everyday effort what it meant to strive conscientiously to improve the quality of life for others, who needed and deserved that attention and effort from them.  And although I have found plenty of ego on display in the public realm, there is no doubt that “others” is a powerful concept located somewhere near the heart of what I hold to be this high calling.\n\n***\n\nDifferent elements in different cultures appear to have cultivated distinctive views on the value and importance of public service.  For many of the ancient Greek philosophers, the task of ruling was a burden to be borne only when unavoidable, with the preferred state being to maintain and exalt one’s independence from such grubby matters to embrace the purer and cleaner life of the mind.  In the virtuous days of the Roman Republic, it was accepted that this responsibility fell upon certain families that were destined and expected to govern the affairs of state and to fulfill the extensive and versatile demands of leadership in the civic life.  In the early theocratic states, the leaders were understood to be chosen for that primary purpose, expressly anointed by God and imbued with his power and wisdom to carry out the duties of leading their people in obedience to their laws.\n\nEach of these models feels distant from the form of democracy that has evolved in the United States and increasingly around the world.  Our leaders must be both self-selected and ratified in some manner by the public.  They typically hold their authority for a limited period and in a limited manner.  They comprise a mixture of elected and appointed officials, whose personal power is specifically constrained by the laws and the Constitution and is subject to extensive checks and balances to prevent undue arrogation of power in any individual.  Public opinion is a chief source of public authority, both as formally registered at election time and as weighing heavily upon all participants during the extent of their involvement in public matters.\n\nIn my case, I have had the opportunity to serve in each of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the government, and I have served at each of the local, state, and federal levels of government.  I have held different positions by personal selection, by public election, and most recently by nomination and confirmation.  From my personal experience, I can say to those who aspire to hold such positions that every such process can be arduous and potentially frustrating, and often is tinged with disappointment and rejection.  Over the course of my career, I have been chosen but also declined for various positions by each of the means described.  In the electoral arena, in particular, I have won two primary elections and lost another; I have won five general elections but lost three.  In 2008, I received more votes than any Democratic candidate for state office in the history of Ohio; yet just two years later, I was defeated for re-election by 1 percent of the vote.\n\nThe vagaries and hazards of public service fall unevenly on different people.  One of the things that I always am curious to know about any public official is whether they have ever lost an election.  I can tell you that few experiences in life feel as bleak as losing an election – running for office all year and having nothing to show for it in the end, after sustaining a highly public and very personal snub from the voters.  Timing has a great deal to do with political results, and the opportunities for public service in that arena are correspondingly hostage to fortune.  Yet I also eventually learned that campaigning for office offered the kind of education that you could never get in school – breathtakingly broad exposure to all kinds of people, perspective on the many different elements of our society, and a challenging test of one’s own personal grit and the capacity to understand and persuade others on matters of public concern.\n\n***\n\nOne point that has mattered enormously in my own case has been the influence and support of mentors.  As I mentioned earlier, Senator John Glenn was my earliest mentor in public service, and he later helped me, starting with my first campaign for the State House in 1990 all the way to my latest campaign for attorney general in 2010.  His deep humility about his glittering record as a military hero, a pioneering astronaut, and a public leader has stamped itself on my mind as applying all the more emphatically for us lesser mortals.  Yet he also has a great sense of humor, and one of my warmest memories of my most recent campaigns was to find something special he has in common with my Dad – both of whom grew up in eastern Ohio during the Depression – as both of them to this day can quote rollicking passages from Robert Service, the poet of the Yukon, from memory.  And he carries with him a deep idealism, which is a quality I seek to emulate constantly, even in the face of the brickbats and larger obstacles that we all encounter.\n\nThe judges I worked for at the beginning of my legal career – Judge Robert Bork, Justice Byron White, and Justice Anthony Kennedy – taught me enormous lessons in attention to detail.  They worked to square the rule of law with actual governance, grappling with how lasting principles should be applied to the real-life situations that emerge in concrete cases.  Each of them also taught me the inner worth of disagreement as a means of sharpening our thinking and seeking out possible consensus without surrendering our values.  I think it is fair to say that each of these jurists has been known for their own fierce independence of thinking.  Yet they never sought to suppress that same quest in me or my peers.  Instead, they showed us true respect by pressing their strong differences of opinion in vigorous discussions while expecting us to do the same.\n\nIn my early career in government service, I was fortunate to have the support and protection of perhaps the most influential lawyer-legislator in the history of Ohio, Harry J. Lehman.  During his time as chair of the House Judiciary Committee, he worked on the development and adoption of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the Ohio Rules of Evidence (all of which still govern all trials in all courtrooms everywhere in the state), while fielding and resolving an immense array of other legal and constitutional issues.  When he retired from the General Assembly, he admirably said that “they will not be able to say of me, ‘no runs, no hits, no errors.’  There have been plenty of all three.”  Having borne the sacrifices of public service himself, he understood and welcomed my early ambitions in that direction, even when I was trying unreasonably to be a lawyer and a legislator and a law professor all at the same time (Harry has spent many years at all three professions himself).  He also impressed upon me the important admonition to remember, always, that public service is not only noble and useful, but also should be an interesting and enjoyable kind of fun.\n\nWhen I later turned my attention to financial offices, first as county treasurer and then as state treasurer, I had the good fortune to re-engage with Mary Ellen Withrow, the former Ohio treasurer and U.S. treasurer.  She led by the power of her example, finding ways to expand the footprint of an executive office to benefit the public.  In her case, she created novel initiatives such as the Linked Deposit program – a small business loan program to create jobs that flourished during her tenure and which I later revived and reinvigorated as the highly successful Grow Now program.  Another was the STAR Ohio program, which pooled together surplus local government and school district funds to yield higher and safer investment returns – another program that I was able to build on and expand during my tenure as state treasurer.  As U.S. treasurer under President Clinton, you would know her by innovations such as the state-backed quarters, the big-faced bills with intricate anti-counterfeiting techniques, the Sacagawea dollar coins, and much else.  She was unafraid to experiment with new approaches, figuring that her successes would outshine her failures, a courageous spirit which I have tried to take very much to heart myself.\n\n***\n\nCircling back for a moment to my parents, one key lesson that I learned about public service is that it comes in many different colors and shapes and flavors.  If the essence of public service is leadership, one can exercise this quality from many different positions in our society.  To begin with, we tend to equate “public service” with “the public sector.”  Even that sector is quite broad and diverse, ranging from civil servants like my parents to appointed and elected leaders in all three branches of the government.  Everyone who serves the public in government has a role to play and the opportunity to fulfill that role in a way that is beneficial to others.\n\nFor example, my Dad once told me a poignant story from the outset of his career.  He was trying to allow a large collection of troubled youths – who may or may not have had any developmental disabilities – to be allowed to spend just twenty minutes outside doing exercises.  This would be a simple break from rigid confinement in a building where they were basically incarcerated.  His boss insisted that it could not be allowed, that the boys could not be trusted not to run away.  My Dad went back again a few weeks later and said he would be held responsible for their conduct, and his boss finally relented.  He then told the boys they had a chance to try something, and if they could handle it well, there might be a chance for more.  Eventually this grew into extensive recreational programs that saved countless young people, otherwise lost in the system, from a dreary life of perpetually fettered gloom.  In my view, that is a shining example of public service.\n\nBut there is much more.  One tremendous fact about America is that we are a society marked by the prevalence of what Alexis de Tocqueville called “voluntary associations.”  He exclaimed over “the immense assemblage of associations” that he saw in this country, and “admired the extreme skill with which the inhabitants of the United States succeed in proposing a common object for the exertions of a great many [people] and in inducing them voluntarily to pursue it.”  What was once known as the eleemosynary and philanthropic elements of our society, which we now refer to more plainly as the “nonprofit sector,” is another strong foundation for exercising leadership in the service of others.  Important institutions such as churches, hospitals, charities, foundations, legal aid groups, and the like are the source of much good in our society, often in conjunction with but also quite distinct from any government involvement.  Some of these associations are a far cry from the small volunteer societies that Tocqueville described, although PTAs, Sunday schools, and other civic groups still have a sturdy presence in our communities.  We should honor and appreciate their many contributions as well, and recognize that many of these entities have their rightful claim to the mantle of public service.\n\nI have also come to understand better than I did many years ago how leadership and service to the community are manifested in the private sector as well.  This is, of course, the “for-profit” sector, and to some people that taints any association with “public service.”  But people must and do make a living in every walk of life in our economic system, and a high sense of public responsibility can be infused into a business enterprise just as much as in any other human organization.  In fact, I would argue that the private sector does not fulfill its proper role without the kind of responsible leadership that imports conceptions of service to the public into their everyday affairs.  These are actually straightforward precepts:  doing business “the right way,” complying with the law, treating people fairly, providing excellent customer service, building a lasting business that can benefit all of its diverse stakeholders, creating value for its customer base, and competing effectively in the marketplace.  These are all hallmarks not only of high business ethics, but of sustainable business excellence.\n\nIt is not a facetious phrase to me from a bygone era that we would think of “captains of business” as being judged once again by how they benefit others – here measured by the profits that flow from creating and sustaining value in a fair exchange with their customers.  And so in my current work, which I will speak more about in a moment, I have no qualms about holding the leaders of our nation’s most significant financial institutions to a high standard of conduct.  Some of the expectations that I just described are required by law; others are not; either way, there is a more tangible standard of serving the public that I find many corporate executives have in mind and envision themselves as trying to meet.  Yet I also believe that our corporate leaders may at times need appropriate regulatory pressure to countervail against the insistent shareholder pressures to pursue pure profit regardless of how they do so.  If markets work properly, ultimately it is the consumers above all who benefit from the successes of our businesses.\n\n***\n\nFinally, I would be remiss to talk about the joys and the challenges of public service and not spend some of my time discussing my current work as the first Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  In many ways, it is as though much of the jumbled experience of the previous decade led almost naturally to this position, which I could not have anticipated and never expected.  The financial education that I received as a public treasurer, which led me to know much about the practical side of the mortgage originations, mortgage servicing, and debt collection, gives me unique perspective on those issues.  The legal education that I gained as an attorney and law professor and then applied as attorney general to such issues as consumer protection, payday lending, debt collection (again), mortgage servicing (again), and the financial abuses on Wall Street, has helped me address similar issues at this new agency.  The executive and management experience that I gained through a succession of smaller to larger offices helped me have some sense of how to run this agency.  Having said that, almost nobody has ever had the experience of doing what we have been asked to do, which was to build an entirely new federal agency from absolutely nothing to steady-state in less than five years.\n\nThere is, of course, a certain amount of sacrifice here just as there is in any other form of public service.  After the president first nominated me to this position, it took two full years for the Senate to confirm me, which it ultimately did by a healthy vote.  The resulting uncertainty cemented for my family that I would have to commute back and forth between Ohio and Washington, because we had settled into that pattern well before my own status was finally resolved.  Moreover, there is a certain amount of angst and criticism around any new government agency, and we have fielded our share of it, though I am quick to point out that if that is the price we have to pay to do the kind of work we are able to do, then it is well worth it.  And one more discouraging thing about any large project is that even though you want so much to do the right thing, you may not be in a position to know whether you managed it until a considerable time has passed.  So you need to be able to have confidence in those around you, and you need to remain open-minded to the evidence that will demonstrate the truth over time.  The anxiety of getting things right is a weight that people in many walks of life – including me here – carry around with them, and it is impossible not to feel that weight if you care about what you are doing and believe it to be important.\n\nWe certainly do feel that way at the Consumer Bureau.  The opportunity to serve as the first Director of this organization, alongside my exceptionally talented colleagues, has been one of the great privileges of my life.  We are the nation’s first federal agency whose sole focus is protecting consumers in the financial marketplace.  The effects of the financial crisis – millions of lost jobs, millions of lost homes, and trillions of dollars lost in household wealth – remain vivid in our collective experience.  So when Congress responded by enacting the financial reform law five years ago, it charged the new Bureau with responsibility to stand on the side of consumers, make sure they are treated fairly, and help restore trust in the financial marketplace.\n\nWe have been fortunate to have great mentors to help us along the way – notably Elizabeth Warren, now the senior Senator from Massachusetts, who conceived the idea of the agency, fought for its creation, and led its initial stand-up efforts.  We also owe much to President Obama, who strongly pushed for our agency and has constantly supported it, including during the prolonged but ultimately successful struggle to seat a confirmed director.\n\nSince opening our doors, we have made considerable progress in fulfilling our rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement responsibilities to protect people all across the country.  We have finalized sweeping new rules to improve the mortgage market and address the problems that led to the financial crisis.  To date, our enforcement actions have resulted in over $11 billion in relief for over 25 million consumers.  Our supervisory actions have changed and improved countless financial practices and have secured redress for another 1.8 million consumers.  We have also handled more than 700,000 complaints from consumers, addressing all manner of financial products and services; we have worked to secure relief where possible and we have prioritized matters for further investigation and action where justified.  We are creating powerful new tools for education and engagement that help consumers know what to expect in the financial marketplace and understand what they can do to protect themselves and assert their rights against financial predators.\n\nIn all of this work, we recognize that ultimately our job is to improve the everyday financial lives of 320 million Americans.  That is an enormous responsibility and a worthy challenge, one that we must approach humbly and realistically, but also conscientiously and energetically.  The same tenacity that is required to accomplish anything in public service is likewise called for in our work at the Consumer Bureau.  What Professor Max Weber once said about politics is just as true of public service:  it “is a strong and slow boring of hard boards.  It takes both passion and perspective.  Certainly all historical experience confirms the truth – that man would not have attained the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible.”  Weber tells us that this requires us to arm ourselves with “steadfastness of heart.”  This reminds me of a quote from Albert Camus’ Myth of Sisyphus, which a friend sent me when I was first nominated:  “The struggle alone is enough to fill one’s heart.”  The common theme here seems to be qualities of the heart; and so we will gladly devote ourselves to continuing that struggle, steadfastly.\n\n            Stay informed\n\nSubscribe to our email newsletter.

I also want to thank the entire AFR coalition, as well as PIRG, the Consumer Federation of America, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Public Citizen, and the National Consumer Law Center for co-hosting this event.  I am aware that Erin Kilroy played a key role in organizing today’s event, so thank you Erin.  And I am especially pleased to be here at SEIU, which works so hard to put money in people’s pockets, whereas we at the Consumer Bureau work just as hard to protect them so their money can stay in their pockets until they are ready to spend it.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I appreciate the invitation to celebrate our birthday with you.  It is impossible to keep from smiling to see so many of our friends in the room.  We know very well how involved many of you were in the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the creation of the Consumer Bureau.  While she could not be here with us today, I especially want to recognize Lisa Donner for her efforts to lead such a large, diverse coalition of stakeholders both then and now – one that consistently encourages the Bureau to fulfill both the spirit and the mandate of Congress through the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nSo let me take just a moment and comment on what is the foundation of our close friendship.  Some of it is just the deep bond you build from sticking it out with each other through thick and thin.  We have certainly done that.  Some of it reflects the experience of being sharpened on the whetstone together, and finding that each of us is tried and true.  But I like to think that the core of our friendship stems from striving always to think together, carefully and honestly, about what steps we can take to help improve the everyday lives of consumers, who struggle mightily with issues of household finances.  To adapt a phrase from Abraham Lincoln, we must continue our work in the financial marketplace to see not that might makes right, but that right makes might.\n\nThe basic premise of the unfettered free market is that the discipline of the market is sufficient to assure that consumers are treated fairly.  Having lived through the financial crisis, we cannot easily accept that approach as the be-all and the end-all.  We do care deeply about how things come out for consumers, and we have seen that they do not always come out well.  And when the economy goes off the rails, the damage done to people’s lives can be severe and lasting.  Many people are simply victims of circumstance, such as young people who graduated from college at the wrong time into a busted economy or families whose homes ended up deeply underwater because of foreclosures down the street.\n\nSo we have hard and important work to do.  At the same time, we include you among our true friends because you give us your honest perspective on what we are doing and how we are doing it.  And that is so immensely valuable to us.  There has been a debate of long standing over Stephen Decatur’s famous statement, “My country, right or wrong.”  If we tried to prevail upon you to have such blind faith in us – this agency, right or wrong – I do not think you would or should do so.  Instead I think we would finally agree on the more noble formulation by Senator Carl Schurz, who restated the point a half-century later as follows:  “My country right or wrong; if right, to be kept right; if wrong, to be set right.”  That is the path that you and we have chosen for ourselves, and it is a happy path for us to travel together.\n\nSo much, then, for philosophy.  Next week marks five years since passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and four years since the Consumer Bureau opened its doors.  As you well know, and with quite a bit of input from many of you in this room, Congress created this agency in response to the financial crisis with the purpose and sole focus of protecting consumers in the financial marketplace.  We understand our responsibility to stand on the side of consumers and ensure they are treated fairly.  Through fair rules, consistent oversight, appropriate enforcement of the law, and broad-based consumer engagement, the Consumer Bureau is working to restore people’s trust and confidence in the markets they use for everyday financial products and services.\n\nIn a very short time, we have done new and important work.  We have begun to supervise markets that have never had direct supervision at the federal level, including student loan servicing, credit reporting, and debt collection.  We have also written mortgage origination rules to help ensure that consumers can afford to repay their loans without being set up to fail and mortgage servicing rules that help end surprises and runarounds for consumers who have bought a home.  We have written rules to provide new consumer protections for remittance transfers, and we are working on rules that would provide new consumer protections for prepaid cards and prepaid accounts, as well as payday loans, debt collection, and arbitration agreements.  We are providing expanded access to financial education in the classroom, in the workplace, in libraries, in social service agencies, for servicemembers and veterans, for older Americans, for the many underserved consumers, and for all consumers generally.\n\nTo date, the Bureau’s enforcement activity has secured more than $10 billion in relief for more than 17 million consumers.  In the past year alone, we have rounded up key partners to join us in this work and achieve more together than any of us could have achieved by ourselves.  For example, together with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and 47 state attorneys general, we just took action against J.P. Morgan Chase to overhaul its debt collection and debt sales practices and provide debt relief to more than half a million consumers.  We recently worked with the Department of Education to obtain $480 million in debt relief to student loan borrowers who were wronged by Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit chain of colleges that allegedly violated the law and has since declared bankruptcy.  And we joined the FCC and several states to take action against Verizon and Sprint, which resulted in more than $100 million in consumer redress and new systemic changes to prevent mobile cramming of unexpected and unjustified charges onto consumer cellphone bills.\n\nLet me focus more specifically, however, on another key element of our work.  When the Consumer Bureau opened its doors, one of the first things we did was begin to accept consumer complaints.  Hearing directly from consumers in their own words about their problems with financial products and services is fundamental to our mission.  It gives us a true compass, in real time, about the issues and problems that individual consumers find themselves dealing with in their financial lives.  It has, in fact, turned out to be foundational to all our work.\n\nIn our first month, we handled fewer than a thousand credit card complaints.  Since then, we have expanded our menu to all manner of complaints about financial products and services, including mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, student loans, deposit accounts, debt collection, credit reporting, payday loans, consumer loans, and more.  As of this month, we have now handled over 650,000 consumer complaints.  From this wealth of information, we have identified, categorized, analyzed, and synthesized what we have heard.  We have quantified how many of these complaints involve mortgages or credit cards or debt collection and the specific types of complaints that consumers have about these and other products.  We have tracked the timeframes for company responses.  And we have specified how many complaints involve different kinds of relief.\n\nSince June 2012, we have built a consumer complaint database and shared individual-level complaint data on our website, to educate the public and improve the functioning of the marketplace –  a first by any financial regulator at the state or federal level.\n\nTo add to the valuable complaint information already available to the public, just a few months ago we started allowing consumers to share their specific account of what happened, in their own words, so that others may read about and better understand their experiences.  A consumer who chooses to make her experience public enables more people to exert their power to improve the financial marketplace.  So publishing these complaint narratives represents a milestone for consumer empowerment.  They are the heart and soul of a consumer complaint.\n\nWe will now be adding to that work by inaugurating a new regular monthly feature.  Starting today, we will be sharing a summary of our consumer complaints every month.  Our new monthly reports will include complaint data on company performance, complaint volume, state and local information, and product trends.  The reports provide a high-level snapshot of trends and analyses found in the consumer complaints we receive.  They can be used to inform the public, the industry, researchers, reporters, and everyone interested in the financial marketplace.\n\nNotably, these monthly reports will include information about a new category in the lexicon of consumer finance, which we call the “most-complained-about companies.”  For example, the three most-complained-about companies in this report are Equifax, Experian, and Bank of America.  Keep in mind that these are also some of the largest companies in this arena that deal with many millions of consumers, so the data needs to be viewed in context.  In fact, we are working on how we can best try to “normalize” complaint data for size and volume, among other things.\n\nThe reports also will have information about whether the volume of complaints are up, down, or unchanged for that particular company from the same time last year.  In addition to informing and prioritizing our work at the Bureau, we believe these analyses can help the industry identify specific areas for improvement.  Indeed, our database is a very effective source of information for an institution to get a sense of what complaints are being made about their competitors and hence what kinds of problems they can work proactively to prevent or avoid in the same markets.  Thus these metrics can help push companies to compete with themselves and with one another to improve their customer service, which will boost their own reputations and foster greater trust in the marketplace.\n\nThe monthly reports will also include information about complaint volume and product trends, such as which products are bringing in the most complaints.  And finally, the complaint information will be broken down state-by-state, so that state officials, local consumer groups, and others can parse the information to find out what is happening in their part of the country.  We also intend to shine a geographic spotlight on the voices and messages from consumers in a particular area of the country.  In this first monthly report, the focus is on Milwaukee, Wisconsin where we recently held a field hearing.  This example is also meant to spur people into creating their own localized reports and seeing for themselves what consumers in their own areas are saying about the financial marketplace.\n\nEach monthly report will also spotlight a particular product to provide more in-depth coverage of findings and trends.  For this inaugural report, we chose to spotlight debt collection, given the large volume of complaints we continue to handle each month about this product.\n\nEach complaint that people take time to submit to the Consumer Bureau can provide invaluable information and insight.  Consumer complaint data is part of our DNA and these complaints play an important role in our supervision of companies, our enforcement actions, our rulemakings, and our engagement with servicemembers, students, the economically vulnerable, and older Americans.  Each complaint is a chance for us to evaluate a perceived problem and see if it can be addressed successfully.  But more importantly, complaints make all the difference by informing our work and helping us identify and prioritize problems.  We know that if we hear about the same problem from fifty consumers, it likely looms larger than if we hear about it only from one or two.\n\nAll of these complaints have real people behind them.  Each tells us a story about how consumers view their experiences with financial institutions, as they struggle to manage the ways and means of their economic lives.  Often consumers ask simply to be treated with fairness, dignity, and respect.  And we all know in our hearts that this is exactly what each of us deserves.\n\nFor example, being on the hook for a debt you do not owe is stressful and can be scary.  If you do not know where to turn, you might feel hopeless.  We heard from William, who was receiving calls for a debt he did not owe.  William tried to resolve the issue for more than four years, and saw his credit being ruined in the process.  He said, “None of them could do anything … except tell me I had to pay them the $8,500.”  But because he submitted a complaint to us, he was able to end the prolonged standoff in just one week.  “Just to have the situation resolved … that just felt good,” William said.  “In a situation for me that was seemingly endless and hopeless, the CFPB helped me to find resolution.  It’s a new day.”\n\nEvery success of this kind is a thrill for us.  One consumer tagged her story about the relief she and her husband got from our handling of a mortgage complaint with the theme from Mighty Mouse:  “Here They Come, to Save the Day!”  We all got a good laugh out of that one, but it was also poignant because apparently it was exactly how she felt.\n\nAs our complaint data is made available to the public regularly through these monthly reports, companies will have more incentive to address potential shortcomings in their businesses that are harming consumers.  This should encourage companies to improve the overall quality of their products and compete more vigorously over good customer service.  We are already seeing this happen.  In the credit card market, for example, the JD Power surveys are showing consistent improvement in customer satisfaction with their credit card issuers.  There are three reasons for that, in my view:  the important reforms made by the CARD Act; the focus that consumers themselves have put on paying down credit card debt; and the changes that companies have made in their customer service.\n\nIt is that last point that I would focus on here:  how certain companies are demonstrating their ability to “up their game” by consciously improving their customer service to not rush people off the phone.  In particular, the use of the “net promoter score” approach to handling complaint calls in the credit card market has done wonders for customer satisfaction and has created more trust and confidence in those financial providers.  So that is a sensible and meaningful best practice.  I would urge all financial institutions to adopt that same approach across all their product lines, and financially incentivize those who directly handle complaints to focus on and carry out this more productive outlook.  At the same time, our approach to consumer complaints can work in tandem to help companies reduce compliance risk, reduce litigation risk, and reduce reputational risk.  It can and will help financial institutions attract, retain, and grow their customer base to expand their business in a more consumer-friendly manner.\n\nIf we can help spur competition based on consumer satisfaction, this has the potential to improve the functioning, transparency, and efficiency of the financial marketplace.  We have seen how PIRG and others are already beginning to “scorecard” companies based on this data, and we want to encourage more of that.  You can help us by seeing that these things happen more routinely and consistently for the benefit of consumers.\n\nEveryone comes to understand from their own experiences how issues of consumer finance deeply affect their lives.  All the ways we deal with money, and all the ways we may need to borrow money to create opportunities for ourselves – to go to school, to buy a car, to buy a home, to start a business – are fundamental to our chances in life.  Student loans, auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, bank accounts, and other financial products can help people achieve their goals.  But we have also seen that these products can pose risks that may undermine or even destroy people’s deepest aspirations.\n\nAt the Consumer Bureau, we are guided in all our work by our mission statement and our vision statement, which we worked with now-Senator Elizabeth Warren to put together in our formative early days.  We aim to be, and I quote, “a 21st century agency that helps consumer finance markets work by making rules more effective, by consistently and fairly enforcing those rules, and by empowering consumers to take more control over their economic lives.”  Our vision statement, which I also will quote, foresees “a consumer finance marketplace where customers can see prices and risks up front and where they can easily make product comparisons; in which no one can build a business model around unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices; and that works for American consumers, responsible providers, and the economy as a whole.”\n\nThese are high standards to live up to, and we know that try as we might we will never manage to live up to them fully.  But the aspiration to be better, and to do the right thing as best we can discern it, continues to motivate and inspire us each and every day.  Thank you for all of your welcome efforts to help us make it so.\n\n            Stay informed\n\nSubscribe to our email newsletter.

By having financial freedom, you can make decisions that align with your values and life goals instead of worrying about how you’ll make your next paycheck. \n\nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, financial freedom and well-being can further be defined through these four elements: \n\nHaving control over your day-to-day, and month-to-month finances\n\nHaving the ability to absorb financial shock\n\nBeing on track to meet your financial goals\n\nMaking the choices that enable you to best enjoy life.\n\nNote\n\nMany people achieve financial freedom when they’re able to live off the passive income generated by their investments. This passive income could include interest gained from retirement and investment accounts, money received through rental and other real estate properties, or wages earned by owning a business.\n\nSuppose you need to incur and save $72,000 a year to fund your dream lifestyle of living in a city and traveling around the world part-time. You currently have $1.8 million in investments and retirement savings. \n\nMany financial advisors say it’s best not to exceed a 4% withdrawal rate of your retirement savings during the first year of retirement if you want your money to last a lifetime. Plus, it’s best to adjust the amount annually for inflation.\n\nUsing the 4% withdrawal rate rule, your portfolio is already generating the $72,000 you need to fund your lifestyle ($1.8 million x.04  = $72,000). Therefore, you’ve reached financial freedom.\n\nNote\n\nRemember that financial freedom will look different (and be defined differently) for every individual. A few of the many factors that impact financial freedom include your individual measurement of quality of life, income, and the area you live in. While one person’s version of financial freedom may include paying off their student loans, another’s may include becoming a high-net-worth individual.\n\n  How Does Financial Freedom Work?  \n\nThe process of working toward financial freedom can be broken down into a few key steps. \n\nDefine what financial freedom means to you: If you had all the money in the world, how would you spend your days? What would you want to accomplish in life?\n\nFigure out how much money you need to afford your version of financial freedom: Calculate how much money you need to save in order to fund the lifestyle outlined in the previous step. How much money you’ll need to have saved depends on your expected annual expenses.\n\nSave as much as you can: When you reach financial freedom, you are no longer living paycheck to paycheck, but instead have enough funds to last and protect you in the event of an emergency. By continuing to save as much as you can, you will be one step closer to your savings goals, no matter what those may be.\n\nLive below your means and save the rest: If you are able to, spending less than you earn is recommended for reaching financial freedom. \n\n  How Much Money Do I Need to Reach Financial Freedom?    \n\nAs mentioned, there is no one amount of money that every person should reach for in order to achieve financial freedom. The amount will vary depending on the individual and their lifestyle goals. \n\nGenerally, though, the amount of money you need to reach financial freedom depends on your expected annual expenses, as well as your annual income. The multiply-by-25 rule is a helpful guide individuals use to calculate how much they should save for retirement, and it can be applied to financial freedom, as well:\n\nFinancial freedom (quantity) = expected annual income x 25\n\nLet’s say you need to have $50,000 a year to afford your dream lifestyle. In this case, your financial freedom amount would be $1.25 million ($50,000 x 25 = $1.25 million). \n\nIdeally, though, in addition to saving regularly from your salary, you would increase the amount of money you save through things like 401(k) employer matches, compound interest on investments, and other sources of passive income.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nTell us why!\n\nOther\n\nSubmit\n\nSources\n\nThe Balance uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

It takes into account factors such as your income, debts, expenses, and savings, and provides a snapshot of your financial situation.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nFinancial health is the state of your financial well-being.\n\nFinancial health is important because it lowers your stress and frees up energy for you to focus on other things, such as your relationships, health, and career.\n\nYou can improve your financial health by building an emergency fund, paying off debt, and saving for retirement.\n\nFinancial health is something that takes time and effort to achieve, but it’s worth it in the long run.\n\n  How Financial Health Works  \n\nMore than 60% of Americans feel anxious about their finances—and this is why good financial health is so important. It often includes things such as having enough money to cover your basic needs, carrying little to no debt, and having some savings set aside for emergencies. When you have good financial health, you have peace of mind around your finances and may live a more stress-free life.\n\nInstead of panicking about how you’ll make ends meet or cover an unexpected bill, solid financial health gives you the power to:\n\nCover an unexpected bill using your emergency fund\n\nLeave an abusive relationship without fear of having no money\n\nChase opportunities that align with your passions versus what will pay the bills\n\nInvest in a housecleaner or meal-prep service to free up more time\n\nQuit a job you don’t like and pull from savings until you can find a new one\n\nNote\n\nFinancial health allows the freedom to make choices that let you live a more stress-free, value-aligned life. It’s about making sure your money is working for you.\n\nHowever, if you’re struggling with low-paying jobs or making ends meet, the traditional definition of “good” financial health may not be possible. For example, more than 1 out of 10 people live in poverty, and more than 10 states have a minimum wage below $8. In these situations, maintaining good financial health isn’t always about saving money or building net worth. It could mean keeping a consistent budget, finding sources of financial help, and avoiding expensive funding such as payday loans.\n\n  Example of Financial Health  \n\nThe term “financial health” can be pretty vague. Here are some concrete examples of good financial health:\n\nYou can handle a major unexpected expense because you have money set aside for emergencies.\n\nYou feel secure in your financial future.\n\nYou feel like you can afford the things you want in life—even if you have to save up for them.\n\nThe way you manage your money allows you to enjoy life.\n\nYou don’t feel financial strain when you buy someone a gift for a wedding, birthday, or baby shower.\n\nYou have money left at the end of the month.\n\nYou control your finances, rather than having your finances control you.\n\nOn the flip side, your financial health could be in bad shape if:\n\nYou feel saddled with high-interest debt.\n\nYou spend all your paycheck as soon as you get it.\n\nYou lose sleep at night thinking about your financial situation.\n\nMoney stresses you out.\n\nYou're frequently worried about being able to make ends meet.\n\nNote\n\nJust like physical health, it's important to take steps to protect your financial health and make sure you're on track to meet your long-term goals.\n\n  How To Measure Your Financial Health  \n\nThere are a few key indicators you can use to measure your financial health.\n\n  Savings Rate  \n\nYour savings rate is a good indicator of your financial health because it tells you how much of your income you save each month.\n\nA 10% savings rate means you save 10% of your paychecks. In general, the higher your savings rate, the quicker you can reach your financial goals.  For example, if you want to buy a car to improve your chances of getting a better-paying job, saving 10% a month can help you store up enough money to cover the cost of owning a car.\n\n  Debt-to-Income Ratio  \n\nYour debt-to-income ratio measures how much of your monthly income goes toward paying off debts. Generally speaking, a good debt-to-income ratio is anything below 36%. Any higher than this, and you could struggle to make your payments or get approved for new loans.\n\nIf you make $4,000 a month and $1,000 of your paycheck goes toward debt, then your debt-to-income ratio is 25%.\n\n  Credit Score  \n\nA high credit score means you're managing your debt well, and you’re more likely to get approved for lower interest rates in the future. If your credit score is low, it means you’ll end up paying more in interest over the long run.\n\nNote\n\nYou can check your credit score through a variety of free credit report sites.\n\n  Net Worth  \n\nYour net worth is the value of your assets (car, house, savings account, stock, etc.) minus the amount of money you owe.\n\nPositive net worth may be a good sign of financial health—it means your assets are more than your debt. For example, if you have $250,000 in assets and $100,000 in debt, then your net worth is $150,000. Negative net worth means you owe more money than what you have in assets—owing $100,000 while having assets worth $25,000 means your net worth is -$75,000.\n\n  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  \n\nWhy is financial health important?\n\nFinancial health is important because it impacts every aspect of your life. It affects your ability to buy a home, provide for your family, retire comfortably, and more. Financial health is also linked to physical and mental health; studies have shown that people with financial stress are more likely to experience anxiety and depression.\n\nHow do you improve your financial health?\n\nImproving your financial health is a process that takes time and effort. But there are a few key things you can do to get started:\n\nSet financial goals so you know what you want to achieve\n\nSpend less than you earn\n\nCreate a budget to track your spending\n\nAvoid unnecessary debt\n\nImprove your credit score\n\nTrack your net worth\n\nWork on changing your financial mindset\n\nWhat are the signs of good financial health?\n\nYou're on your way to good financial health if you:\n\nHave an emergency fund\n\nHave little to no high-interest debt\n\nCan pay your bills and still have money left over to fund your goals\n\nHave a budget and you're good at sticking to it\n\nRarely stress about money\n\nFeel confident and in control of your finances\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nTell us why!\n\nOther\n\nSubmit\n\nSources\n\nThe Balance uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Still, the pandemic has had (and continues to have) an unprecedented impact on many lives. Factors like unemployment, reduced wages, and business closures, for instance, have reshaped people’s financial priorities and spending habits. \n\nAt a time when many Americans may be reassessing their financial behaviors and futures, The Balance asked several renowned personal finance experts and influencers to share their own narratives from the past year and how they’ve informed their perspectives in areas like budgeting, investing, and achieving financial independence. Today, we speak with Erin the “Broke Millennial” Lowry. \n\nUnder her moniker the “Broke Millennial,” Erin Lowry has carved out a successful career providing practical financial advice to fellow millennials through multiple books, presentations, worksheets, and courses. Unfortunately, quarantines and lockdowns in the first few months of the pandemic diminished her opportunities to take the stage for speaking engagements and in-person events, which she told The Balance account for a good portion of her income. \n\nHowever, after enduring what she calls the initial “scariness” of the ongoing health and economic crisis, Lowry has found some stability through digital speaking engagements, and has seen a renewed interest in her books, including “The Broke Millennial Takes on Investing.” \n\nAccording to the New York City-based author and influencer, this increase in interest may be a reflection of people getting through the “shock and awe” of the initial months, and now figuring out the next steps of their financial lives. As her professional mantra, “get your financial life together,” takes on more importance, Lowry spoke with The Balance about investing early, the need for financial conversations, and the pros and cons of personal finance advice on social media. \n\nThis Q&amp;A has been edited for length and clarity. \n\n  For those who haven't read your books, what would you recommend right now for beginning investors?  \n\nBroadly speaking, figure out first where you are—I call it putting on your financial oxygen mask. There's a checklist that you have to fulfill before you have put yourself in a position to invest in taxable (non-retirement) accounts. That being said, if possible, please take advantage of your employer-matched 401(k). And if you're self-employed, please have either a simple IRA, a traditional IRA, or Roth IRA, depending on your situation and what your accountant says is best for you.\n\nNote\n\nLearn what the difference is between a traditional and Roth IRA. \n\nThe biggest soapbox I have around investing is that we use the wrong language when we talk about retirement, because we just say, “save for retirement.” You are not saving for retirement. You are investing for retirement, and you need to think about it as such. One, because you need to make sure that money is actually invested and not sitting in a cash management account inside of your 401(k), or similar retirement account. And two, I do think it just helps people reposition themselves as investors in their own mind. It’s important to start early. \n\nPlease do not wait until you have paid off every last bit of debt, especially student loan debt, auto loans, or heaven forbid, waiting to pay off a mortgage before you start actually investing, even into your 401(k). Because for many of us, especially millennials and certainly Gen Z, you could be well into your 40s before you're “debt-free.”\n\n  Is that a common mistake you’re seeing?  \n\nWell, it's also a common mistake because there are personal finance “gurus” who give that advice to wait until you're debt-free before you start investing. And for some people, that gets interpreted as also meaning in your retirement account. So if you're waiting on a 401(k) until you're in your 40s, you've lost a lot of potential. I don't say that to freak anybody out who has, for a variety of circumstances, waited until their 40s. But it's so much easier to get much further with less effort if you start investing in your 20s or 30s than if you wait until your 40s—especially if you want to retire in your 60s. I just feel that investing is such a critical way that the average person can build wealth.\n\n  How should millennials, and maybe even Gen Z, address financial priorities in light of economic uncertainty?   \n\nI think a hugely critical part is that we have to engage in awkward financial conversations, because we need to be getting information from the people that impact us directly. It’s like, “So Mom and Dad, are you going to have enough money to retire? Am I going to be your retirement plan? I need to know that now—not at 50—because I need to start making decisions about my financial life based on the future situation.” \n\nNote\n\nOur interactive MoneyTalks tool can provide you with advice for how to have a conversation with someone about saving for retirement. \n\nIf you have a partner, have conversations early about both of you having debt, and if so, how do you plan to handle it? Do you have different assets? How are you planning to merge your money? How are you making decisions? If one person wants to start their own business, what is that going to look like? How are we paying for health insurance? \n\nBeing an adult is exhausting. I think that is truly what the pandemic has taught all of us. It is the sobering reality that everybody's been punched in the mouth. Perhaps a beautiful consequence of the pandemic will be that some of us have more clarity on what we actually want, and are going to be better at prioritizing our wants compared to what the society tells us, what culture tells us, what our parents, friends, and siblings tell us. And there's nothing wrong with that as long as we can have healthy conversations about it.\n\n  Why is it awkward to have financial conversations?  \n\nIt's hard talking about money. What's awkward is no one likes getting judged. And that's what we're afraid of in a lot of these money conversations. We all have our own inner critic that's going to be serving us all these scripts about if you do this, this is what they're going to think, this is what they're going to say.\n\nOne of the things we need to remember, though, is that morality and money get intertwined so often when we talk about finances. It’s like the “you're to blame, you did this to yourself,” shame-based behavior that's way too common. [The pandemic] is such an outlier event where truly people had no culpability for what happened. If you worked on Broadway and it's been shuttered since last March, you could have had a six-month emergency savings fund that was gone six months ago. Like, you could have done everything right, and still...\n\nThere's just going to be a collective trauma coming out of this experience that is going to be really important for us to acknowledge and figure out how to incorporate into our work. And part of this, for me, is knowing that I'm not going to have the answer for everybody that follows me. So I’m pointing to resources or other people who might have a more similar lived experience to someone else who was following me.\n\n  That’s probably why social media has been a go-to for personal finance advice, especially now.   \n\nThe really great thing is there are so many different voices within the personal finance space on social media and podcasts, YouTube, and you have TikTok now.  However, some of them are giving advice that's not the best and you should fact-check. But on the other hand, a lot of people are giving advice now that's even more curated, customized, and nuanced to a specific experience, which is really important and is going to be so critical on the back end of this pandemic.\n\n  Do you worry about, as you alluded to, the potential for misinformation?   \n\nListen, as they say, free advice is usually worth exactly what you paid for it, which makes me giggle because I give away a lot of free advice on the internet. But you can always fact-check somebody. Even for my advice, check me against other people and what they are saying. When it comes to your money, you should always get a second opinion. It's just like a medical professional. Go get a second opinion.\n\nAnd that is particularly true of anybody who is prescriptively telling you what to invest in, who doesn't actually know you, who's just talking to the internet. Please be careful. Definitely go check and do some due diligence because with investing especially, [those giving advice] don't know you, your financial situation, or your risk tolerance. They don't know anything that's important to know about you, to then tell you whether something is a good investment.\n\nNote\n\nLearn how to grow and protect your investments with these tips. \n\nBut there are folks who are more focused on the basics of personal finance who aren't pushing  a product or an investment and are just giving advice. And that’s OK, especially if it's tied to a particular lived experience that's more akin to your own. I cannot provide a nuanced answer for every single person’s situation. There's going to be some level of what I do that has to be generalizations, and the same is true for most people. But that is why a certain proliferation of voices in social media has been incredibly helpful. Because then you can find people who speak to your experience in many different forms. \n\nIt could be as simple as somebody who is on the same type of debt journey that you're on, or somebody who also was raised by a single mother in a similar part of the country that you are in and has a similar emotional reaction to money that you do. \n\nAt the end of the day, we just need to have more empathy in personal finance.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nTell us why!\n\nOther\n\nSubmit\n\nSources\n\nThe Balance uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Catalano\n\nReviewed by\nThomas J. Catalano\n\nThomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018. Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nlearn about our financial review board\n\nFact checked by\nJulian Binder\n\nIn This Article\n\nView All\n\nIn This Article\n\nImproving Your Business—How Often?\n\nOrganize Your Processes &amp; Workspace\n\nRevisit Your Finances\n\nConnect With Your Community\n\nConnect With Your Employees\n\nConsider Acquisitions\n\nKnow When You Need Support\n\nFAQs\n\nPhoto: \nsinology / Getty Images\n\nThere were more than 32 million small to medium-sized businesses in the U.S. as reported by the U.S. Small Business Administration in 2021 alone. Yet 20% of these businesses close by year one and nearly 50% by year five. The reasons for lower survival rates in small businesses are numerous, but a major component of business failure is stagnation.\n\nImagine an entrepreneur who found success in launching a business. Their operations and growing customer base have kept them busy through the early phases, but they notice a plateau around year two. To make it as part of the 50% still operating by year five, the entrepreneur needs to be dedicated to persistent improvement efforts.\n\nSmall business owners who get their business in motion need to think a few steps ahead to avoid an elongated plateau. With the right tactics in mind, any entrepreneur, including you, can improve business and tackle times of slower growth. You just need to know where to begin.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nSmall business owners have a likelier chance of failing when they don’t actively work on improving business operations.\n\nTapping into the current market and people associated with your business can support efforts to revitalize.\n\nGetting organized with paperwork, finances, and different buyout opportunities provides a further place for expansion.\n\n  How Often Should You Look for Ways to Improve Your Business?  \n\nEvery entrepreneur has a goal of sustainable growth in mind. Moreover, it takes dedication to consistent research and improvements. That means having a good awareness of where you currently stand, to identify where you need to go, including:\n\nKnowing your cash flow and areas where you could curb spending\n\nBeing connected to your customer base and the social platforms they’re on\n\nUnderstanding your weakest areas and where to ask for support\n\nSustainable growth means constant improvement efforts and being open to trying new things. Quarterly, thorough reviews are a great starting place if you feel out of your element with this startup-like mindset.\n\n  1. Organize Your Processes and Workspace  \n\nThe deeper you get into your business, the more cluttered it can become–literally. You may have things such as paperwork spread across your deck, an unsorted Google Drive, and subscription services with old payment details. Your goal to improve business becomes easier when you implement more organization and efficiency.\n\nA great starting point is reviewing your technology and streamlining it with simple digital services. Get rid of applications you don’t use, convert paper files into digital ones, and add relevant team members to platforms.\n\nNote\n\nEvery business owner can benefit from the power of automation, and you don’t need to be a computer whiz. Start simply by sending a welcome message to a new subscriber or saving attachments to a drive.\n\nPrioritize taking stock of your progress and learning from your mistakes. You’ve probably tried a lot of strategies to get your business off the ground, but doing what got you to Point A won’t necessarily get you to Point B. Review past processes, identify what didn’t work, and update your business strategy to avoid the same mistakes.\n\n  2. Revisit Your Finances  \n\nTo improve business, you need to know financial numbers like the back of your hand. This includes everything from cash flow to your business’s credit score. Cash flow is a key indicator of growth or early failure, with 46% of small businesses exiting with irregular cash flows.\n\nBy revisiting your finances, pay close attention to the accuracy of numbers and determine where you may be spending egregiously. Where are you spending where you should be saving? The only way you can identify financial improvements is by knowing your numbers.\n\n  3. Connect With Your Community  \n\nDo you remember how you vigorously hunted for customers in the early days? Chances are that spark has dimmed over time, and you may have lost contact with customers to focus on other aspects of the business.\n\nReengaging with your community is a necessary and fulfilling method to enhance business. In fact, 86% of loyal customers will refer others to a business, furthering the community around brands. You can tap into this method by finding new ways to connect with customers, including:\n\nVirtual meetups with loyal customers\n\nFarmer’s-market tables for attracting local consumers\n\nLive social media videos, sharing tips or fun content\n\nMonthly emails to customers with updates\n\nTo build a community for your brand means building relationships with customers. When you focus on them as people, you find ways to connect in a way that feels more personal.\n\nNote\n\nEngage your local business community and find fellow entrepreneurs. These relationships could be professional, sending referrals your way, and personal, acting as a sounding board for new ideas.\n\n  4. Connect With Your Employees  \n\nYour employees are also influential on your path to improving business. Creating a positive work environment for your team encourages motivation, productivity, and fresh ideas.\n\nEmployees seek out workplaces where they feel valued and respected, and you can implement strategies to create spaces for intentional conversation and celebration. This could be anything from an open-door policy between you and employees to quarterly team feedback meetings and birthday or holiday greetings.\n\nNote\n\nTo attract the best talent means offering attractive benefits, and the hottest one at the moment is remote or hybrid workplaces. Offering even one work-from-home day per week allows for a diverse team, attracting those seeking flexible work arrangements.\n\n  5. Consider Acquisitions and New Development  \n\nA great way to focus on business development is by looking around. Your market is full of inspiration and insightful data, such as a new niche, a trend, or a competitor. You may pinpoint a struggling business that could be open for a buyout, a potential opportunity to break into a new clientele.\n\nYou should also aim to diversify your product lines based on the results of your research. The social world has made it easy to stay aware of trends, especially on TikTok, with its 1 billion users. This is a great way to keep your business fresh and in the social conversation. And remember, staying on trend could simply mean marketing or branding a classic product in a new way.\n\n  6. Know When You Need Support  \n\nThe final method to improve business may be a hard lesson for some headstrong business owners. But you need to get comfortable knowing when you’re out of your league and ask for guidance.\n\nNote\n\nThe SBA offers specific mentoring programs for small business owners. You can also find business owner support groups on LinkedIn or at local business development or innovation centers.\n\nAs you build out the business, strive to put together an advisory board, formally or informally. Identify individuals whom you feel comfortable with and who know the business and industry. Having a trusted group to go to for advice makes a difference.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the key activity you can do to strengthen your business is taking a break. Hitting a plateau offers a time to reflect on your business’s progress and where you see its future.\n\nHow Do I Improve My Business Credit Score?\n\nA business credit score functions similarly to your credit score, meaning you already have experience in maintaining this. A few ways to improve your score would be to limit credit usage, pay bills on time, and avoid closing accounts. Get into the habit of reviewing your business credit report regularly and reporting any inaccuracies.\n\nHow Do I Improve Google Search Results for My Business?\n\nImproving your Google search results means getting familiar with search engine optimization. SEO is a marketing strategy that focuses on getting a business higher on a search page when using select keywords. Getting better placement means selecting pertinent keywords, creating content with those on your site, and optimizing said content for more relevancy.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nTell us why!\n\nOther\n\nSubmit\n\nSources\n\nThe Balance uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

You'll also sometimes hear them referred to as &quot;work values.&quot; \n\nKnowing what you value in a job and workplace can help you evaluate career options to consider and assist you with choosing a job that's the best fit for your values.\n\n  What Are Career Values?  \n\nYour career values represent the beliefs you have about what is important in your work, and what makes it meaningful to you.\n\nSimply put, your career values are what steer and drive you in your professional career. These values will help when you decide on a potential company or position for employment. \n\n  What Do You Want From a Job?  \n\nPeople look for different things in their jobs. Some crave prestige, while others seek a creative outlet. Still others want flexible hours and independence.\n\nThe list of desires can include earning a high income and meeting and interacting with people. Of course, the chance for advancement in the career field is also a primary driver of why people will choose any particular position.\n\nNote\n\nValues vary greatly from person to person. What matters to one may mean little to another person. So, it is essential to understand your own unique value system.\n\nOnce you figure out what you value, you'll have the answer to what motivates you to do your best job, and you can use this knowledge to guide your employment choices.\n\n  Career Satisfaction  \n\nSome career theorists believe that how well a job or career satisfies our values should be the most important consideration when evaluating options.\n\nThese theorists posit that work which lines up with our values will be more meaningful, and we will be more likely to invest our energies to master the roles and achieve success. Most career experts recommend considering personality traits, interests and abilities in conjunction with values when making career choices.\n\n  Identifying Your Values  \n\nOne way to identify your career values is to look at a list of examples and rate how much each of the items matters to you. Rate the list on a scale of one to ten. Then examine some of the highest-rated values and choose six to 10 that should have the greatest weight when considering career and alternatives.\n\nYou can also separate these descriptive terms into categories, such as who, what, where, and workload. Instead of a numerical ranking system, you may choose to rank the terms using:\n\nMust have\n\nNice to have\n\nOK not to have\n\nMust not have\n\nWhether you use a ranking system or buckets, the important thing is to have a clear sense of what matters most to you. Remember, this will be unique to you — don't get tripped up by thinking about what peers or family members prioritize.\n\nNote\n\nUse CareerOneStop's Work Values Matcher to find careers that match your personal work values.\n\n  List of Possible Career Values  \n\nSome of the values you want and require in your work or career probably involve qualities and opportunities that enhance your life emotionally and intellectually. Achieving these values as part of your job or career might make you feel challenged, inspired, and fulfilled.\n\nSome career or job values have to do more with the environment in which you spend a large proportion of your waking hours, and the conditions under which you perform your work.\n\nWhile these values may not offer as much emotional fulfillment, they can make your work life easier to navigate, such as having a mentor, or easing financial stress, because you have job security.\n\nThe following list captures examples of some of these types of values:\n\nAdventure\n\nAutonomy\n\nAvoiding stress\n\nBuilding things\n\nCamaraderie\n\nCasual work environment\n\nChallenge\n\nChanging the world\n\nCollaborating with others\n\nCompetition\n\nCreating new things\n\nCreativity\n\nDiversity\n\nEmployee benefits\n\nExposure to beauty\n\nFast pace\n\nFun\n\nHelping others\n\nHigh income\n\nHigh level of interaction with people\n\nIncomebased on productivity\n\nInfluencing others\n\nIntellectually demanding work\n\nJob security\n\nLocation\n\nMoral/spiritual fulfillment\n\nOpportunity for advancement\n\nOpportunity to lead\n\nOpportunity to learn new things\n\nOutlet for creativity\n\nPhysical activity\n\nPleasant work environment\n\nPower\n\nPrestige\n\nRecognition\n\nRisk-taking\n\nRoutine work\n\nSeeing tangible results from work completed\n\nSharing ideas or information\n\nSocialization\n\nSolving problems\n\nStatus as an expert\n\nStructure\n\nSupportive management\n\nTeam membership\n\nTime freedom\n\nTravel\n\nVariety of tasks\n\nWork/life balance\n\nWorking alone\n\nWorking outside\n\nYou can also use this list to generate ideas for different types of jobs or positions to explore if you're in the midst of a job search, and flesh out your resume by adding a few in your resume's employment objective section and in your cover letter.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nKNOWING YOUR WORK VALUES IS IMPORTANT. This can help you know when it's time to leave a job, how to pick between two jobs, and countless other career-related decisions. \n\nTRY EXERCISES TO DETERMINE YOUR VALUES. For instance, looking at examples of things that people value in a career — such as work-life balance, learning opportunities, the pace of the day, travel opportunities, and so on — can help crystalize what you prioritize the most.\n\nYOUR CAREER VALUES ARE UNIQUE. Everyone will weigh various factors differently. And, at different times in your life, your own work values may shift.\n\n     \n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nTell us why!\n\nOther\n\nSubmit\n\nSources\n\nThe Balance uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Will you purchase a home in the suburbs, or rent a condo in the city? How many children will you have, if any at all? What values are most important to you? There are many important topics to discuss and align on (or at least compromise on) if you want your marriage to stand strong against the pressures of time. \n\nBut one area many couples struggle to agree on is money. Whether that means how to spend it day to day, or what goals to start saving toward, disagreement in this area can spell disaster for even the best relationships. \n\nIf you’re having a hard time getting your spouse to engage in financial discussions or get on board with the financial plan or goals, the experts of Kiplinger Advisor Collective are here to help. Below, they offer up their top tips for how couples can approach financial alignment in a way that will strengthen their relationship for the long term. \n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance\n\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\nSave up to 74%\n\nSign up for Kiplinger’s Free E-Newsletters\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\nSign up\n\nInvolve them in the planning process\n\n“In marriage, a financial plan must represent both partners' goals, so it's important to involve your spouse in the planning process. Seek their perspective on what your future life should look like. Visualizing your goals — like where you might live or travel to when retired — will enable you to align goals and get your spouse on board with a budget and savings plan.” — Andrea Woroch, Woroch Media Inc. / Andrea Woroch\n\nImplement 'money date nights'\n\n“Start a ‘money date night’ where both of you review your finances together in a relaxed setting. Use this time to discuss goals, listen actively and align on priorities. Establishing regular, open conversations about money fosters understanding and collaboration, ensuring both partners are invested in achieving shared financial goals. I currently practice this with my partner, and it's very helpful!” — Amrita Choudhary, Wasabi Technologies\n\nSeek help from an objective third-party\n\n“Financial planning is a very personal matter and should be personalized for each family's situation. You sometimes may need an outside third party to objectively counsel and work through your relationship with you — the same applies to your financial life. Seek advice from an outside financial professional (a fiduciary) who can be objective and apply their knowledge without emotion tied to it.” — Shawn Maloney, Retire Wise, LLC\n\nKiplinger Advisor Collective is the premier criteria-based professional organization for personal finance advisors, managers, and executives. Learn more &gt;\n\nWork as a team to build trust\n\n“Have the hard conversations about money and keep having them. Issues around money are some of the toughest challenges in any partnership. I am seeing a trend where young people keep their finances separate from each other. When times get tough, and they will, this lack of trust will put immense pressure on the relationship. Talk about money and build a habit of joint financial decision-making.” — Elizabeth Graham, Riggs Asset Management Co., Inc.\n\nDo your homework\n\n“It's hard to be in a marriage if you are hiding something or fooling your spouse. You both need to be on the same page. Work to convince your spouse about the merits of certain investment assets, and do your homework on how you can convince your significant other why you need that asset to hedge your shared portfolio.” — Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\n\nLead with empathy\n\n“Approach the conversation with empathy, asking your spouse for their thoughts on the financial plan. Present your perspective and use a simple pros and cons assessment to evaluate both views together. This encourages trust and ensures you both feel heard. By working as a team and making joint decisions, you strengthen the relationship and align your financial goals.” — Jabin Geevarghese George, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.\n\nEnsure open lines of communication\n\n“I would recommend making sure the lines of communication are open. Sit down with one another and have an honest conversation about each person's financial goals and concerns, really trying to put each other in the other person's shoes. This will help you empathize and understand each other. Doing that helps achieve mutual understanding.” — Bob Chitrathorn, Wealth Planning By Bob Chitrathorn of Simplified Wealth Management\n\nRelated Content\n\nWedding Season: Three Steps to Empower Your Finances as a New Couple\n\nHere’s What Couples Need to Know About Merging Finances\n\nHow to Handle Money Effectively as a Blended Family\n\nIs Budgeting Overrated?\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nBy Frank J. Legan\n\n published 28 October 2023 \n\nin Features\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, it's easy to fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others, especially when it comes to our finances. Social media, advertising and even our social circles bombard us with images of success and wealth. As a financial adviser, I've witnessed firsthand the detrimental effects of this comparison game on individuals' financial well-being.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore why it's crucial to shift our focus from comparison to purpose. Where we might find ourselves comparing our journey to others, we should instead embrace and embark on a purpose-driven approach to financial planning. I'll also provide actionable steps to help you prioritize your unique financial journey.\n\nThe pitfalls of the comparison game\n\nIt's human nature to look at others and wonder how we measure up. Paying too much attention to what anyone else has or what they’re doing is never a good idea. We see our friends' new cars, exotic vacations and seemingly effortless financial success, and we can't help but feel a twinge of envy. However, this habit of constantly comparing ourselves to others can be corrosive, leading to financial and mental turmoil. The pitfalls to avoid:\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance\n\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\nSave up to 74%\n\nSign up for Kiplinger’s Free E-Newsletters\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\nSign up\n\n1. Buying into the illusion\n\nFirst and foremost, it's essential to recognize that what we see of others' financial lives is often just the tip of the iceberg. Social media and public displays of wealth don't reveal the whole picture. Behind closed doors, people may be struggling with debt, financial stress or personal challenges that aren't visible to the outside world. Comparing ourselves to an illusion can lead to unnecessary anxiety and discontent.\n\n2. Neglecting your unique financial story\n\nConventional wisdom in finance often emphasizes numbers and benchmarks. While these metrics are essential, they can neglect the most critical aspect of your financial journey: your unique story and aspirations.\n\nEvery individual has different goals, values and circumstances. By constantly comparing ourselves to others, we risk losing sight of what truly matters to us. As financial adviser and author Carl Richards puts it, &quot;Personal finance is more personal than it is finance.&quot;\n\n3. Ignoring the wisdom of Theodore Roosevelt\n\nTheodore Roosevelt once said, &quot;Comparison is the thief of joy.&quot; These words hold timeless wisdom, reminding us that comparing ourselves to others robs us of the joy that can be found in our own financial journey. Instead of striving to replicate someone else's success, we should focus on building a path to financial success that is uniquely ours.\n\nEmbracing a purpose-driven approach to financial planning\n\nNow that we understand the pitfalls of the comparison game, let's explore five actionable steps to shift our focus from others to ourselves when it comes to financial planning.\n\n1. Define your financial goals\n\nStart by setting clear and specific financial goals that align with your values and aspirations. What do you want to achieve? Whether it's buying a home, retiring comfortably or paying off debt, your goals should reflect what truly matters to you.\n\n2. Create a personalized financial plan\n\nWork with a financial adviser to create a personalized financial plan tailored to your unique goals and circumstances. Your plan should outline a roadmap to achieve your objectives and address potential challenges along the way.\n\n3. Stay informed, not obsessed\n\nIt's essential to stay informed about financial matters, but don't obsess over every financial move others make. Instead of comparing your investment portfolio to a friend's, focus on the long-term strategy outlined in your financial plan. Periodically review your plan with your adviser to ensure it remains aligned with your goals.\n\n4. Practice gratitude\n\nCultivate gratitude for what you have achieved in your financial journey. Take time to appreciate your progress, no matter how small it may seem. Gratitude can help you find contentment in your financial life and reduce the urge to constantly compare yourself to others.\n\n5. Avoid impulsive decisions\n\nAvoid making impulsive financial decisions based on what others are doing. Just because someone you know is investing in a trendy stock or pursuing a particular investment strategy doesn't mean it's right for you. Stick to your well-thought-out plan and consult your adviser before making significant financial moves.\n\nConclusion: Your journey, your success\n\nIn the world of financial planning, it's time to shift our focus from comparison to purpose. Your financial journey is unique, and your success should be measured against your own goals and values, not someone else's.\n\nPeople who constantly compare themselves to others tend to be focused only on numbers. Yes, I’m a financial adviser, and of course I care about numbers, but we know financial planning is only partly a numbers game.

Legan\n\n published 2 November 2024 \n\nin Features\n\nThe transition from the carefree days of summer into the more structured rhythm of fall and the school year is a great opportunity to reassess and rebalance.\n\nAfter a season full of vacations, outings and unplanned expenses, it’s normal to feel the effects of a financial hangover. Attaching your “why” to the excesses can help you realize the motivation behind them. You aren’t wrong for wanting to create lasting memories with your loved ones, bond with your friends on nights out or dive deep into hobbies that bring you joy. Don’t kick yourself for overspending. Instead, I think it’s more useful to find ways to fulfill your need for joy and connection in a way that squares with your financial reality.\n\nIn any event, you are certainly not alone. Between May 2023 and 2024, the average price of sports event tickets alone jumped from $204.91 to nearly $249.27, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. So, if you had the exact same kind of summer fun as you did last year, it’s safe to say that you had to pay more for it.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance\n\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\nSave up to 74%\n\nSign up for Kiplinger’s Free E-Newsletters\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\nSign up\n\nStart by telling the truth\n\nAll progress starts with truth, so before we can move forward, we need to see where we stand. It’s time to review the numbers. How much did you spend versus what you budgeted? Did you dip into savings or rely on credit cards more than anticipated?\n\nFirst, review any outstanding debt from summer expenses. If credit card balances have crept up, now’s the time to create a repayment plan to avoid high interest charges. Effective strategies to pay off debt can include the “Avalanche Method,” paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first, or the “Snowball Method,” where you start by paying off the smallest balance first. If your emergency fund took a hit, consider rebuilding a three- to six-month cushion before tackling any discretionary spending. Your goal is to protect yourself from more financial strain down the road.\n\nAgain, we’re not trying to beat ourselves up over summer costs that got away from us. Acknowledge the parts of your financial plan that are still on track. Where did you stay on budget or even manage to save a little money? Most budgeting apps allow you to generate reports over time. The more you use them, the more you can identify positive trends. Identify your financial strengths so you can create a plan that aligns with your long-term goals.\n\nPractical steps for rebalancing your budget\n\nWith your financial standing clear, it’s time to rebalance or revise your budget. This might involve reworking your budget to better reflect your lifestyle or setting aside money throughout the year for bigger expenses.\n\nConsider setting up a specific “summer fund” within your budget. Allocate a small portion of your monthly income toward this fund so you can establish ahead of time what your spending limit will be. Ideally, you avoid both the financial stress of overspending and the temptation to splurge on impulse purchases. And you don’t have to limit this strategy to summer spending, either. You can do the same kind of early budgeting for the winter holidays too and reap the same benefits.\n\nWhether you prefer a more informal approach or want to use technology to assist with tracking your expenses, the key is to find a system that works for you. There is no one-size-fits-all method. Budgeting apps and traditional methods, such as spreadsheets or a dedicated notebook, can help you get a clear picture of your financial situation and plan effectively for upcoming expenses.\n\nAlign your budget with your life's purpose\n\nYour summer spending habits might indicate bigger patterns of spending and saving in your financial life. Cutting back and tightening your belt will only get you so far without zooming out to look at your values and long-term goals. Think about the choices you made over the summer — what brought you the most happiness? What activities or experiences were worth every penny?\n\nAlternatively, consider where you might adjust. Were there expenses that didn’t bring much value or could have been done differently? By recognizing these patterns, you can make more intentional financial decisions going forward.\n\nThe shorter days, cooler weather and turning leaves that mark the beginning of fall are a good psychological signal to reset and reflect on your spending habits. Don’t punish yourself for overshooting your budget … and if you don’t have one, it’s never, ever too late to start. Life never turns out the way we expect, and that includes our financial lives too. You’ll know you’re on the right track when your financial plan has enough flexibility to account for the odd splurge or setback without throwing the rest of your life into turmoil.\n\nInvestment advisory services offered through SEIA, LLC.

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nBy Andrew Rosen, CFP®, CEP\n\n published 14 October 2024 \n\nin Features\n\nWhen it comes to financial planning there are so many ways to attack it. Additionally, I find one of the hardest things for people to do is to prioritize their needs. Oftentimes, individuals conflate importance with immediacy, as in the sooner something is approaching, the more important it must be. Although I certainly understand this mindset, I don’t believe it is the appropriate way to handle one’s finances.\n\nI’d like to take a stab at listing in order of priority how, I believe, we should be looking at our finances. Naturally, it is not one-size-fits-all and, of course, I, nor anyone else, can tell you what is most important to you.\n\n1. Protect yourself and your family\n\nTo me, the biggest and most important thing you should focus on first is protecting yourself and your family from a tragedy that could derail everything. This usually means making sure you have appropriate insurance coverage. Let’s face it — you can always work longer and make more money, but only if you are physically able.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance\n\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\nSave up to 74%\n\nSign up for Kiplinger’s Free E-Newsletters\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\nSign up\n\nAll too often, I see individuals who are in a terrible bind because they didn’t have a contingency plan with proper insurance. Life, disability, long-term care, health, property and casualty — these are the basics of a good foundation to build off of. Without proper insurance, you are building a financial plan on a house of cards.\n\n2. Get rid of destructive debt\n\nNext on my list is bad debt, like credit cards. I want to make a clear distinction — I am not referring to mortgages or car loans. Rather, I’m referring to those credit card debts with high interest rates. These can simply crumble a family financially and need to be addressed.\n\nYou need to have a well-thought-out plan to eliminate high-interest debt, and it is equally important to ensure that you don’t end up back in this hard-to-recover-from place.\n\nI rank this as a top priority because people can be stuck with high credit card debt for years, especially if they make only the minimum payments.\n\n3. Save for emergencies\n\nSimply put, you should have three to six months of expenses saved in an emergency fund that’s easily accessible. Many times, people end up with high-interest credit card debt simply because one unexpected expense broke their finances. Having a nest egg or slush fund to insulate you from that situation is highly important.\n\n4. Save for retirement\n\nFinally, something fun to talk about, right? There is an epidemic in our country, and that is that most people don’t have enough savings, or aren’t saving enough, to ensure they can afford a comfortable retirement.\n\nYou cannot borrow for retirement, and at some point, you might be forced to retire. The last thing you want is to be staring down a 30-year retirement but unable to afford the lifestyle you’re accustomed to.\n\nAdditionally, the sooner you start saving and the more effort you make in this area, the better your options will be to live the retirement of your dreams.\n\n5. Focus on other savings goals\n\nNow that emergency and retirement savings are on target, you can focus on other savings priorities, whether they be college for your children, a second home or a big project. These items aren’t critical to your financial plan, and there are generally other means to achieve these goals, such as borrowing for college.\n\nI am not suggesting these shouldn’t be important to you now, as they may seem more important to you than how comfortable your far-off retirement will be. But everyone will need to retire, yet everyone won’t need a secondary home.\n\n6. Consider paying off constructive debt\n\nIt is probably a tie for me on the next, and last, two categories. I’ll give a slight edge to paying off constructive debt, like a mortgage or car loan. If you have a low mortgage rate, though, I see very little benefit to aggressively paying off a home, except for the peace-of-mind factor. After all, if you are mortgage-free, you’ll have fewer fixed expenses heading into the next stage of your life, which can leave you feeling mentally clearer and more able to continue making good financial choices.\n\n7. Give to charity\n\nIt might seem messed up to have charitable giving as the least important piece of your financial plan. Certainly, a great argument can be made that it is the most important, and I even have clients who prioritize this over almost anything else. I get it and actually highly admire those people.\n\nThat said, if I am looking out for my client’s finances first and foremost, like I’m supposed to, and the things above aren’t in a good spot, giving money away seems, well, conflicting at best.\n\nLet the debates begin, but I’m sticking to my story that this is what I feel works best for most people. There are exceptions to every rule, and people can always shuffle this deck to their own circumstances. This is just my opinion on what I’ve seen work best in my 20-plus career.\n\nHope you enjoyed it, and stay wealthy, healthy, and happy.\n\nDiversified, LLC does not provide tax advice and should not be relied upon for purposes of filing taxes, estimating tax liabilities or avoiding any tax or penalty imposed by law.

Northwestern Mutual’s study also found that 35% of Americans say financial compatibility is more important than physical or intellectual compatibility.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance\n\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\nSave up to 74%\n\nSign up for Kiplinger’s Free E-Newsletters\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\nSign up\n\nThe data also revealed the power of these financial conversations on the overall strength of a relationship. Almost across the board, reports of financial challenges in relationships tended to slope downward over time — as couples address financial issues, establish joint financial goals and plans, generate more income and accumulate more wealth. While younger couples struggle more than older ones with seeing eye-to-eye on finances, Boomers+ are almost 20 percentage points more likely to agree with their partners about managing money — and also 25 percentage points less likely to say that finances are a significant issue in their relationship.\n\nIt’s clear that candid conversations about money can help couples fall in love with their future, too, so these discussions should not be feared. There are three important money conversations every couple should have — conversations that can influence what their life will look like together as they take that next step. However, many couples are unsure how to get started. Here are some questions to help them do just that.\n\nConversation #1: Share dreams and goals to make them a reality.\n\nOpenly sharing dreams and goals is one of the best parts of being in a relationship. Whether personal, professional or financial, sharing thoughts and hopes for the future is essential for supporting each other as a couple move forward together — especially if these dreams involve money.\n\nConversations can — and should — be fun. Try to make them playful!\n\nIf you won the lottery, what would you do with the money?\n\nIf you could erase one of your debts, which one would it be?\n\nWhat is on your bucket list, and how can we plan for it?\n\nConversation #2: Determine how to manage money collaboratively to lessen future disagreements.\n\nGetting to know each other means having deeper money conversations. These are some good questions to get the conversation started:\n\nWhat long-term goals do you have? What long-term plans do you have in place to achieve them?\n\nHow much do we have saved, and how much debt do we have?\n\nDo we plan to merge our accounts or keep our finances separate?\n\nHow much money do we make together — and who will be responsible for items such as the rent or mortgage, utilities and food?\n\nUnderstanding each other’s financial habits can help couples avoid uncertainty and address any significant differences. These conversations can also help partners determine where they have financial strengths and potential blind spots they may want to address with the support of an outside expert. Oftentimes, engaging a trusted financial adviser to facilitate more complex discussions can be helpful to ensure alignment on key issues and strategies.\n\nConversation #3: Discuss how you will live together to help guide your future partnership.\n\nTalking openly about future living arrangements can help a couple plan for their future together. These are some things to consider when a couple aim to live together:\n\nWhere are our families located — do we want to be nearby?\n\nWhere are our jobs located — are jobs remote, or do either of us need to be in the office?\n\nDo we want to rent or own — or does one of us already have a home?\n\nDo we want to live in the city, the suburbs or out in the country?\n\nConversations in relationships should not be considered “one and done.” In fact, ongoing discussions with your partner can continue guiding your future together and increase your financial compatibility. Although combining financial circumstances may initially be overwhelming — consistent, honest money conversations are beneficial. Commit to the conversation — and then your future.\n\nRelated Content\n\nFive Tips for Becoming a Financially Successful Couple\n\n10 Steps for Having Better Money Conversations With Your Spouse\n\nThe Real Reasons Couples Argue About Money\n\nHow to Avoid Tricky Financial Problems in Marriages\n\nWhat Financial Infidelity Is - And How to Avoid Problems\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis article was written by and presents the views of our contributing adviser, not the Kiplinger editorial staff.

Beach, CFP®, AWMA®\n\n published 14 December 2023 \n\nin Features\n\nWhen you think about how much you spend every month, you probably don’t feel much happiness about it. What if you could?\n\nThe word “budget” is enough to make us get up from the computer and go do anything else. If you want an easier way to figure out how much you spend, divide two years of total expenses by 24 (most banks make the total debit number easy to find online). And, voilà, you now have a pretty good idea of what your monthly expenses are. That number is probably going to be higher than you thought — and unpleasant.\n\nYou might feel something different, though, when you go a few levels deeper to the line items. You might cry as you think about the $2,500 you spent to fix a leaking pipe. You probably can’t remember what you bought for $850 at Costco. But you smile as you remember the family trip for Thanksgiving, despite the outrageous flight prices. The purpose of this article is to help redirect your spending to create more smiles.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance\n\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\nSave up to 74%\n\nSign up for Kiplinger’s Free E-Newsletters\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\n\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\nSign up\n\nI have distilled down several studies at the intersection of spending and happiness to come up with four strategies to get more return on investment (ROI) on your spending:\n\n1. Spend in alignment with your values.\n\nThis one may sound obvious, but ask yourself: Do you know your values? There are several exercises we use with clients to help them define their core values. I think of values as life-long goals. These are mine (which are the same as our firm’s):\n\nFreedom (time and financial)\n\nRelationships\n\nHelping others\n\nGrowth\n\nYou can see from that list that buying a new flat-screen is unlikely to provide much long-term happiness (for me!). However, I do get excited when I see Travelzoo’s email with its top 20 deals come through every Wednesday. I also know that if I splurge there, I’m going to get a higher happiness ROI.\n\n2. Remember that experiences deliver more happiness than things.\n\nPretty much every study, including the often-cited Harvard Study of Adult Development (aka, the world's longest study of happiness), agrees on this principle. But why? Most of it boils down to the reality that the joy derived from buying things is short-lived.\n\nThe concept of adaptation and the hedonic treadmill help to explain why things bring only short-term joy. Humans tend to revert back to a relative level of happiness once the sugar high delivered by a new possession has subsided. In contrast, the joy associated with experiences lives on through three phases: anticipation, event and memories. Memories become stories.\n\nI recently traveled to Italy with my young children. The 5-year-old got very sick on the plane, and we ended up having to throw away the dress she was wearing. With the rest of her clothes below deck, my wife’s shirt became her new dress. While this was not at all funny in the moment, I am giggling as I write this, illustrating the recurring ROI from experiences.\n\n3. Invest in relationships.\n\nI had two clients move from the Washington, D.C., metro area to Florida during the COVID pandemic, seeking sunshine and a lower tax bill. In doing so, they left their social circles behind. This is one of the biggest mistakes I see retirees make. Both clients moved back.\n\nThe Harvard study referenced above goes deep into the benefits of close relationships. Of course, you cannot spend to create these relationships, but you can use money as a tool to deepen them. Here are a few strategies:\n\nUse proximity of relationships as the driver for where you live in retirement. Moving to Florida to avoid income taxes, to Delaware to reduce property taxes or to New Hampshire to skip out on sales tax and income tax is not a good strategy in and of itself. You’re better off spending a bit more (assuming you can) to live closer to friends.\n\nTake that trip … with friends. Spending at the intersection of things you love to do and people you love comes with a large ROI. Often, this comes in the form of group travel.\n\nGive thoughtfully. We can all remember a gift that we went above and beyond for. I remember, as a kid, saving money and then taking a bus to the mall to buy my mom earrings that I had seen in a holiday catalog. I believe they cost $30. In retrospect, I’m pretty sure I got more out of giving that gift than my mom did from receiving it.\n\n4. Replace working with giving.\n\nI am not saying right when you stop earning a paycheck, you should start writing charitable checks, though you could do that. Giving, of both time and financial resources, usually increases happiness and overall well-being.\n\nIn a previous column, Will You Have a Happy Retirement (Even With Enough Money)?, I noted the challenges of walking away from work and losing identity, relationships and structure. Giving helps address all three of those. When we get involved in a cause in retirement, it gives us a new identity. We are now philanthropists. Others who donate their time and money to the same cause often become a new pool of people with whom we build relationships. Our ongoing commitments to said cause now give our lives some structure.\n\nI'm not trying to persuade you to delete your Amazon account, but to think of money differently. Money, in its purest form, is just a tool — a tool that can help provide security, flexibility and, ideally, happiness.\n\nRelated Content\n\nIs Your Spending Out of Control?

Perhaps you’re focused on a personal goal — like losing weight or getting more sleep — or a professional goal, such as landing a promotion in your current company. In addition to focusing on those ambitions, it’s essential to set your sights on financial goals.\n\nWhat are financial goals?\n\nFinancial goals are measuring sticks that apply to any area of your money management skills that you’re looking to improve.\n\nWhile setting financial goals is a crucial piece of an individual’s well-being, the majority of Americans struggle to pinpoint something to work toward with their money. In 2020, only 38 percent of adults in the U.S. had specific financial goals, according to research from the Lincoln Financial Group.\n\nWhy financial goals are so important\n\nYou might think about what you want to achieve with your money, but making that rosy picture of personal finance a reality requires a specific, actionable plan to follow. Goal setting can break down a much larger objective into smaller steps, allowing you to feel an increasing sense of accomplishment as you get closer to reaching it. That positive reinforcement can put some wind in your sails and keep you pushing forward, particularly for the tougher steps that may lie ahead.\n\nThink about running a marathon. Rather than trying to walk out the door and run 26.2 miles tomorrow, you might set a goal to run for 15 minutes today. As you continue working toward race day, the goals continually get more challenging, but your regular progress has helped make the remainder of the training feel more within your reach.\n\nThe same principle can apply to setting financial goals. When it comes to money, what gets measured gets done. If you set a goal to save 10 percent of your monthly income, you can regularly look at your account balance to make sure that’s actually happening. Setting those goals is a way to hold yourself accountable on the journey to financial security.\n\nMonitoring and making adjustments to your financial goals\n\nSetting a financial goal is not a set-it-and-forget-it act. To reach any goal, you need to regularly calculate how far you are from getting there. It’s important to monitor your progress and make adjustments where necessary.\n\nHow often you track your status depends on the type of goal. For example, if you’ve decided to set a goal to stick to a budget, you’ll need to monitor your progress throughout the month — not only when you’re doing your tally on the last day of the month. By then, it’s too late to recognize if you’re overspending.\n\nFor long-term goals such as saving for retirement, those evaluations can have wider windows between them. Perhaps you can use your quarterly 401k statements as your check-in dates, or you can set up a couple of appointments with your financial planner to discuss whether it’s time to shift your strategy.\n\nAs you think about your financial goals, it’s important to remember that life happens. You might encounter an unexpected job loss, a huge set of medical bills or some other major event that will derail the initial path you planned. This can mean adjusting those goals or hitting the pause button for a while until you can get back on track. It also may lead to an entirely different set of goals and priorities.\n\nExamples of major financial goals\n\nSome financial goals require your immediate attention while others seem like distant points on the horizon. Those varying time frames will impact your priorities and your strategies for reaching them.\n\nShort-term financial goals\n\nShort-term financial goals are those objectives that demand your immediate attention. For example, if you have accumulated credit card debt, paying it off to avoid additional charges should be at the top of your to-do list. While you’re getting that monthly balance to zero, you’ll also want to set a budget to track your spending and avoid the same pitfall in the future.\n\nThere are fun short-term financial goals, too. If you want to take a spring break vacation next year, put together a plan to save for those expenses. With monthly deposits set aside, you can enjoy a getaway without the worry of returning to any debt.\n\nMedium-term financial goals\n\nWith medium-term financial goals, you have some additional time on your side. Perhaps you’re aiming to buy a house, and you want to save a sizable down payment of 20 percent to avoid paying mortgage insurance. Maybe you want to save enough money to buy your next car in cash. These goals may not seem like they’re right around the corner, but the right savings strategy will put them a bit closer.\n\nLong-term financial goals\n\nThe classic long-term financial goal is retirement. In your twenties, still early on in your career, leaving the workforce may feel like it’s a world away. However, that’s the best time to set a goal: When you have longer to get there and you can maximize an employer-sponsored retirement plan and an IRA. If you wait to set your retirement goals until you’re 45, it may feel like you’re staring up at an impossibly high mountain, and you’ll feel overwhelmed about where to start climbing.\n\n13 popular financial goals\n\nIf you aren’t sure where to start with setting your financial goals, consider some of the key milestones that appear on many peoples’ lists.\n\nBuild an emergency fund\n\nSet a budget\n\nGet out of credit card debt\n\nImprove a credit score\n\nPay off a car loan\n\nSave for a vacation\n\nBuy a home\n\nPay off student loan debt\n\nSave for a child’s college education\n\nPay off a mortgage\n\nBuy a vacation home\n\nSave for a comfortable retirement\n\nLeave an inheritance to heirs or a charitable organization\n\nNo matter what financial goals apply to you, be sure to add establishing your financial literacy (and constantly strengthening it) to the list. One of the key pieces of your success is being a lifelong learner, dedicated to learning more about saving and investing. With that commitment to education, you’ll be able to set the right goals at the right time.\n\nEdit Icon\n    \n      Cite us\n\nShare Icon\n        \n            Share this article\n\nShare Icon\n            \n                Share this article\n\n                        Facebook Icon\n\n                        Twitter Icon\n\n                        LinkedIn Icon\n\n                        Email Envelope Icon\n\n                        Close\n\n                Written by\n\n                Greg McBride, CFA\n                \n                    Arrow Right Icon\n\n                Chief financial analyst, Personal Finance\n\n                    Connect with Greg McBride, CFA on Twitter\n                    Twitter Icon\n\n                    Get in contact with Greg McBride, CFA via Email\n                    Email Envelope Icon\n\n                    Read more from Greg\n\n            Greg McBride, CFA, is the Chief Financial Analyst for Bankrate.com, leading a team responsible for researching financial products, providing analysis, and advice on personal finance to a vast consumer audience.\n\nExplore our top credit card picks\n\n          ×\n\nSelect a category:\n\n              Balance transfer →\n\n              Cash back →\n\n              0% Intro APR →\n\n              Business →\n\n              Best credit cards →\n\n    You may also like\n\n                        Bankrate's 2024 Credit Card Award Winners\n\n                        GreenPath Financial Wellness debt management: 2024 Review\n\n                        Personal Finance\n\n                        Saving for retirement when you’re in your 40s\n\n                        Retirement\n\n                                By James Royal, Ph.D.\n\n7 min read\n\n                        How to set your investment goals\n\n                        Investing\n\n                                By Brian Baker, CFA\n\n5 min read"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:40:51.056060"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2357]]

But I’ll be the first to admit that, as a person with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), I often have difficulty following a lot of common personal finance advice myself.\n\nPeople like me with ADHD struggle with executive functioning skills, and that can have a massive impact on their quality of life, including on the ability to manage finances. People with ADHD have extreme difficulty engaging in tasks they find boring or unpleasant (like budgeting), have difficulty keeping track of details (like when bills are due) or have poor impulse control (like overspending).\n\nLiving with ADHD can be challenging, and if it affects your ability to manage money, that can impact much more than just your day-to-day finances — it can affect your mental health, too.\n\nBefore I was diagnosed with ADHD, I tried countless common strategies to manage money, only to feel frustrated and hopeless every time. Since then, I realized I was following advice for people without ADHD. But my brain worked differently, and I had to manage my finances differently, too.\n\nThese are just a few methods I use to manage money as a person with ADHD. Whether you have ADHD or you just want to try some new budgeting strategies, consider these steps to start paying down debt, save more and budget like a pro.\n\n    5 tips for meeting your financial goals when you have ADHD\n\n                                                            “Out of sight, out of mind” isn’t always best.\n\n                                                            Make budgeting as manual as possible.\n\n                                                            Give yourself frequent rewards.\n\n                                                            Put up roadblocks to avoid impulsive spending.\n\n                                                            Lean on your support network.\n\n1. ‘Out of sight, out of mind’ isn’t always best.\n\nTraditional budgeting advice heavily emphasizes setting bills on autopay from your checking account and forgetting about them. While that’s great advice for many people, it never worked for me. If I don’t check my bank account frequently, I won’t realize until weeks or months later that I forgot to cancel a subscription or that a regular bill jumped in price.\n\n    Star Icon\n    \n                    Keep in mind:                Did you know some services let you change your own monthly billing date? I set my own dates for my internet, car loan and more. This helps me space out all my bills equally throughout the month and avoid feeling overwhelmed on the first of the month.    \n\nMy solution? A homemade budgeting spreadsheet, where I track my bills, monthly spending, debt repayment progress and monthly budget. I’m paid biweekly, and every payday, I sit down and pay all my bills for the upcoming two weeks, then move money into savings. Whatever is left is free to spend. That way, I know exactly how much money I have for food and discretionary spending over the next two weeks. By managing my money this way, I feel in control of my own finances and feel more confident making financial decisions. (You can also try this by setting up split deposits, if your bank offers them.)\n\nThis is an example page of my personal budgeting spreadsheet, which lets me track money coming in, which bills are coming up, which bills I’ve paid and how much money I have left after bill payments.\n\n    If that isn't for you:\n\n        While keeping a meticulous spreadsheet works for me, budgeting can be confusing or anxiety-inducing for many ADHDers. Try keeping close eyes on your budget, but if you’re still having trouble, consider a budgeting app that puts in the effort for you. YNAB is often highly recommended among ADHDers for its methodical budgeting strategy.\n\n2. Make budgeting as manual as possible.\n\nBy “manual”, I mean holding money literally in your hands in order to better understand your cash flow. Spending exclusively on debit and credit cards is very easy — sometimes too easy. Some ADHDers find it harder to stay on track of their spending when they can swipe a card for every purchase.\n\nI use a physical planner for all my weekly meetings and to-do lists, and my desk is covered in sticky notes, notebooks and other bits of paper. If that describes your process, why not make your budgeting physical, too? Try pulling your discretionary funds in cash after you pay bills. Grab some envelopes, label them and divide your funds, just like you would with a budgeting spreadsheet.\n\nFor example, if you have $500 every pay period after bills, you might put $100 in cash in an envelope marked “Savings,” $300 in “Food and household” and another $100 in “Fun money.” This is also called cash stuffing, and it’s a great way to help ADHDers who have a hard time visualizing money. Don’t just visualize your funds — hold them.\n\n3. Give yourself frequent rewards.\n\nMaking savings goals isn’t usually someone’s idea of an exciting Friday night. ADHDers often have a hard time focusing on topics that don’t interest them or don’t have immediate rewards, so it can be hard for some to prioritize staying on budget or saving money. But while saving isn’t immediately rewarding (at least, not as much as spending money), it’s an important tool for meeting your financial goals.\n\nSo, why not reward yourself for your goals now? If you want to save more, try setting rewards for yourself at specific savings amounts, such as every $300 or $500 saved. Make your rewards small (along the lines of a meal out, rather than designer clothing), and make them frequent. If you only set rewards once you save $10,000, it will be harder to find the motivation.\n\nDavid DeWitt, a certified financial planner with ADHD who specializes in financial planning for people with the disorder, says his clients have a hard time wrapping their heads around far-off possibilities, like buying a house. They need smaller goals to stay grounded.\n\n“When it comes to money, we’re really wired to (have) steep discounts on future rewards and very high premiums on near-term rewards,” DeWitt says. “Things that we can see and feel and can tangibly wrap our head around — we place a higher value on that, because it’s in our mind.”\n\n            Dollar Icon\n\n                Need more motivation?\n\nConsider apps like Habitica or Do It Now, which are habit trackers that let you gamify your habits to battle monsters and dress up characters. Making an extra debt payment can feel a little more exciting if it gives you the points to slay a dragon.\n\n4. Put up roadblocks to avoid impulsive spending.\n\nImpulse spending can be a major problem for ADHDers. The urge to get something now, even if it’s out of your budget, can sometimes be too strong to ignore.\n\nIf you struggle with impulse spending, consider the 24-hour rule: If you’re tempted to buy something online, leave it in your cart for at least 24 hours. The next day, you might find that you were less excited about the actual item and more excited about the thrill of buying something fun.\n\nI’ve also had success doing no-spend weeks, where I swear off buying anything except for groceries and other household necessities for a week, to tamp down on my monthly spending. Meeting my goal and ending the week successfully without buying anything extra can be a great boost in motivation.\n\nDeWitt says he wasn’t able to buck his own overspending habit until he was able to understand his own values. It wasn’t until he began to weigh the benefits of buying something now versus the security of savings that he could begin to change the habit. But it’s not an overnight process, he says.\n\n“If you really are an impulse spender who’s in a habit, expect it to take a long time, like over a year of continuously having to go forward, take a step backward, keep addressing it. But it will pay off if you keep at it,” DeWitt says.\n\n5. Lean on your support network.\n\nUnfortunately, talking about money is still taboo for many Americans. But as an ADHDer, I find that my goals are much easier to meet when I lean on my family, friends and support system.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you may be familiar with how working on a project is much easier when someone’s holding you accountable. Use the same principle in your personal finances — pair with people in your life who have similar financial priorities. You can swap budgeting tips, share the best deals in your city or even start a savings challenge.\n\nThese conversations can be tricky to start, but because I’m more comfortable talking about my situation than I am asking about someone else’s, I’ll ease people into the conversation by asking for advice for myself. For example, I’ve approached friends in the past (typically other ADHDers, who understand my situation) and said something like, “I’ve been struggling with saving more. Do you have any hacks you’re using right now?”\n\nFriends have offered tips on spending less on groceries, saving money on books and other helpful advice. They wouldn’t have known to mention those tips if I hadn’t asked. More often than not, after I asked, they shared their own struggles with paying down debt and saving more.\n\nLearning to manage your personal finances can feel alienating, especially if you’re trying brand-new methods. But you may be surprised how many people, with ADHD or without, can relate to the struggle to stay focused on your goals. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, staying on top of your personal finances isn’t always easy — or as immediately rewarding. These are just a few tips that work for me, but you might find a different approach works better for your brain. There’s no one way to approach your personal finances. Learn what works best for you, and use those skills to write your own budgeting rulebook.\n\nEdit Icon\n    \n      Cite us\n\nShare Icon\n        \n            Share this article\n\nShare Icon\n            \n                Share this article\n\n                        Facebook Icon\n\n                        Twitter Icon\n\n                        LinkedIn Icon\n\n                        Email Envelope Icon\n\n                        Close\n\n                Written by\n\n                Lane Gillespie\n                \n                    Arrow Right Icon\n\n                Writer, Personal Finance\n\n                    Connect with Lane Gillespie on LinkedIn\n                    LinkedIn Icon\n\n                    Read more from Lane\n\n            Lane Gillespie is a writer for Bankrate, specializing in writing well-rounded financial content that answers readers' questions, regardless of where they are in their financial journey.

If so, you might be part of the growing trend known as ‘soft saving.’\n\nThis approach to personal finance, which is popular among Generation Z, is transforming how we view money, saving and retirement. Bankrate’s Financial Success Survey found 56 percent of Americans say they would consider themselves financially successful if they were living comfortably. While becoming a millionaire or purchasing a luxury car used to be the ultimate goal, more people are content with simply being able to afford necessities and enjoy life.\n\nSoft saving may offer immediate gratification and align with personal values, but it presents its own unique set of challenges. Here’s a look at the soft saving trend and how it affects saving now and in the future.\n\nWhat is soft saving?\n\nSoft saving is a financial approach that focuses on enjoying the present, with less emphasis on budgeting, saving and investing for the future. It’s about living a lifestyle that prioritizes quality of everyday life, well-being and setting boundaries over the traditional hustle culture.\n\nIt’s part of the ‘soft life’ trend, which chooses comfort and low stress over work culture, and embraces experiences that align with personal values rather than focusing solely on long-term financial savings.\n\n“Soft saving is the opposite of movements like FIRE, short for Financial Independence, Retire Early,” says Melissa Almuttar, director of financial services at H&amp;R Block. “You have this spectrum of saving, and soft saving is at the end.”\n\n“Some people are getting to the point where they’re like, ‘No, I don’t want to do this,’ Almuttar says of a work- and savings-focused lifestyle.\n\n“It’s the moment where you’ve had enough, and you want to do something different.”\n\nSoft savers may still be engaging in low-stakes savings challenges, contribute to a 401(k) up to the employer match and maintain an emergency fund, but they generally save less aggressively for the future than traditional financial advice might recommend.\n\nExamples of soft saving\n\nSoft saving can take many forms. Many soft savers are choosing to spend money on travel, fine dining or pursuing a hobby that brings joy and fulfillment. This could also mean choosing a job that offers a better work-life balance, even if it pays less, instead of pushing for a higher-paying job that involves longer hours and higher stress.\n\nInstead of cutting out discretionary expenses completely, soft savers may choose to spend on experiences that enrich their life and align with their values. Some might still contribute to retirement savings and even maintain an emergency fund, but generally, they’re forgoing the opportunity to save or invest aggressively for long-term goals.\n\nHow soft savings can affect your savings and retirement\n\nWhile soft saving allows for immediate fulfillment and gratification, it can impact your ability to save for long-term goals, such as retirement or buying a home. Emphasizing present comfort and wellness over future financial security can lead to reduced savings, potentially slowing the growth of your retirement nest egg over time.\n\n“Some might argue that soft saving allows you to enjoy, live and spend in the moment, rather than save for an uncertain future. However, I worry that soft saving ignores emergencies and the ability to cover unforeseen expenses,” says Tim Pilczak, senior advisor at O’Brien Wealth Partners.\n\n“The idea of spending money in lieu of having an adequate rainy-day fund can force people into debt and unwanted stressful situations like seeking additional employment,” adds Pilczak.\n\nWhen less money is saved and invested, the benefits of compounding interest are lost, which means you may need to save more money later on to meet the same financial goals. For example, if you begin saving for retirement at 25, you’ll need to set aside much less each month to reach a certain retirement goal than if you begin saving at 35, thanks to the power of compound interest.\n\nWhat’s driving the soft saving trend?\n\nThe soft saving trend is largely driven by younger generations prioritizing quality of life over wealth accumulation. Generation Z, in particular, is facing economic challenges such as a tough job market, inflation and student loan debt, leading them to focus on immediate fulfillment and experiences rather than long-term financial security.\n\nMany employers are responding to this shift by offering flexible work arrangements and opportunities for skill development, further encouraging the trend toward soft saving.\n\nHow to save for a healthy financial future\n\nWhile soft saving offers the appeal of immediate gratification and a stress-free approach to finances, it’s important to balance this lifestyle with responsible financial habits. Here are strategies that can help you strike the right balance:\n\nEstablish a spending plan\n\nA spending plan helps you manage your income and set priorities for your money. It includes all your income sources and expenses and allows you to allocate funds for savings and discretionary spending.\n\n“Do everything in moderation,” says Pilczak. “A good financial plan considers short-term emergency savings, supporting your cost of living, enjoying life and saving for the future.”\n\nWrite down financial goals\n\nWhether it’s saving for a vacation, buying a home, or retiring at a certain age, having clear financial goals can motivate you to save and make smart financial decisions.\n\n“You really have to think about your goals and ask yourself if you want to spend more on things now or if you want to work less later,” says Almuttar. “Figure out how you want to live your life and the right balance for your situation.”\n\nAutomate your savings\n\nSetting up automatic transfers to your savings account can ensure that you regularly contribute to your savings. Over time, even small contributions can add up to significant savings.\n\nInvest for the future\n\nConsider investing a portion of your income in retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can help your savings grow quickly.\n\nStay informed\n\nBuilding financial literacy can help you make informed decisions and adjust your financial plan as needed. The right steps will help you strike a balance between enjoying the present and preparing for the future. With careful planning and responsible financial habits, you can enjoy life today while securing your financial future.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe rise of soft saving has reshaped how people approach money. While this trend offers immediate gratification, it can negatively impact your ability to save for the future. It’s important to find a balance between enjoying life now and securing your financial future through responsible money management.\n\nEdit Icon\n    \n      Cite us\n\nShare Icon\n        \n            Share this article\n\nShare Icon\n            \n                Share this article\n\n                        Facebook Icon\n\n                        Twitter Icon\n\n                        LinkedIn Icon\n\n                        Email Envelope Icon\n\n                        Close\n\n                Written by\n\n                Sheiresa McRae Ngo\n                \n                    Arrow Right Icon\n\n                Writer, Consumer Banking/Personal Finance\n\n                    Connect with Sheiresa McRae Ngo on Twitter\n                    Twitter Icon\n\n                    Read more from Sheiresa\n\n            Sheiresa McRae Ngo is a staff writer at Bankrate.

For example, if you begin saving for retirement at 25, you’ll need to set aside much less each month to reach a certain retirement goal than if you begin saving at 35, thanks to the power of compound interest.\n\nWhat’s driving the soft saving trend?\n\nThe soft saving trend is largely driven by younger generations prioritizing quality of life over wealth accumulation. Generation Z, in particular, is facing economic challenges such as a tough job market, inflation and student loan debt, leading them to focus on immediate fulfillment and experiences rather than long-term financial security.\n\nMany employers are responding to this shift by offering flexible work arrangements and opportunities for skill development, further encouraging the trend toward soft saving.\n\nHow to save for a healthy financial future\n\nWhile soft saving offers the appeal of immediate gratification and a stress-free approach to finances, it’s important to balance this lifestyle with responsible financial habits. Here are strategies that can help you strike the right balance:\n\nEstablish a spending plan\n\nA spending plan helps you manage your income and set priorities for your money. It includes all your income sources and expenses and allows you to allocate funds for savings and discretionary spending.\n\n“Do everything in moderation,” says Pilczak. “A good financial plan considers short-term emergency savings, supporting your cost of living, enjoying life and saving for the future.”\n\nWrite down financial goals\n\nWhether it’s saving for a vacation, buying a home, or retiring at a certain age, having clear financial goals can motivate you to save and make smart financial decisions.\n\n“You really have to think about your goals and ask yourself if you want to spend more on things now or if you want to work less later,” says Almuttar. “Figure out how you want to live your life and the right balance for your situation.”\n\nAutomate your savings\n\nSetting up automatic transfers to your savings account can ensure that you regularly contribute to your savings. Over time, even small contributions can add up to significant savings.\n\nInvest for the future\n\nConsider investing a portion of your income in retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can help your savings grow quickly.\n\nStay informed\n\nBuilding financial literacy can help you make informed decisions and adjust your financial plan as needed. The right steps will help you strike a balance between enjoying the present and preparing for the future. With careful planning and responsible financial habits, you can enjoy life today while securing your financial future.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe rise of soft saving has reshaped how people approach money. While this trend offers immediate gratification, it can negatively impact your ability to save for the future. It’s important to find a balance between enjoying life now and securing your financial future through responsible money management.\n\nEdit Icon\n    \n      Cite us\n\nShare Icon\n        \n            Share this article\n\nShare Icon\n            \n                Share this article\n\n                        Facebook Icon\n\n                        Twitter Icon\n\n                        LinkedIn Icon\n\n                        Email Envelope Icon\n\n                        Close\n\n                Written by\n\n                Sheiresa McRae Ngo\n                \n                    Arrow Right Icon\n\n                Writer, Consumer Banking/Personal Finance\n\n                    Connect with Sheiresa McRae Ngo on Twitter\n                    Twitter Icon\n\n                    Read more from Sheiresa\n\n            Sheiresa McRae Ngo is a staff writer at Bankrate.

In fact, a recent Bankrate study found that 50 percent of people in the U.S. are carrying a credit card balance, and 58 percent of them don’t have a plan to pay it off.\n\nWhile true emergencies are sometimes to blame, credit card debt is often a result of deciding to splurge. A surprising 38 percent of Americans say they would be willing to go into debt to have fun. Others unintentionally rack up debt by confusing “wants” and “needs.”\n\nWhen having a casual conversation, have you ever found yourself saying things like, “I really need a coffee,” or “I need those shoes”? In most cases, these types of things are nice to have but aren’t true needs. Understanding the difference can go a long way toward improving your long-term financial health.\n\nWhether you’re putting together a budget for the first time or making plans for your future, drawing a clear line between wants and needs will help you achieve your goals.\n\nThe difference between needs and wants\n\nDistinguishing between wants and needs can be a challenge, especially in a marketing-driven society.\n\nFor example, many people were searching for the glasses they “needed” to view the 2024 solar eclipse to avoid retina damage. However, millions have viewed solar eclipses through pinhole projectors or by indirect viewing for thousands of years. So, by definition, solar viewing glasses aren’t a need, even if they can be an affordable and understandable want.\n\nYou may find it helpful to look at needs and wants through Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, a theory that categorizes human needs into five levels, progressing from basic to higher-order needs:\n\nPhysiological: Essential for survival and includes air, water, food, shelter and sleep\n\nSafety: Physical safety, financial security and protection from harm\n\nLove and belonging: Social connections, intimate relationships and a sense of belonging\n\nEsteem: Recognition, respect and self-worth\n\nSelf-actualization: Personal growth, fulfillment and the realization of potential\n\nWhen it comes to economic needs vs. wants, there’s something important to remember: Money doesn’t buy love, belonging, esteem or self-actualization.\n\nThe simplest approach to distinguishing between wants and needs is to assess whether an expense is necessary for survival and safety or merely enhances your comfort or lifestyle.\n\nWhen considering financial needs, ask yourself:\n\nWill this purchase contribute to my basic survival needs?\n\nDoes this expense align with my immediate financial priorities?\n\nIs this purchase essential for my safety and security?\n\nIn personal finance, needs should always take precedence over wants. A list of essential expenses (needs) vs. discretionary spending (wants) can provide clarity and guide your spending, so you can make progress toward your goals even when your budget is tight.\n\nExamples of needs in personal finance\n\nFinancial needs are essential expenses required to meet basic living standards. For example, you need to make sure your rent is paid and the power is on.\n\nNeeds include:\n\nDebt obligations: Payments on current student loans, credit cards, car loans and other debts\n\nHealth care: Regular health check-ups, necessary medications and emergency medical care\n\nHousing: Rent or mortgage payments, required insurance, property taxes, maintenance and repairs\n\nGroceries: Basic, nutritious foods necessary for health and well-being (rather than luxury items or snacks)\n\nTransportation: Public transportation fares, gas, tolls, parking, vehicle maintenance and repairs\n\nUtilities: Electricity, gas, water, sewer, trash collection, basic phone services and internet\n\nPrioritizing your needs can provide stability and security by ensuring you’ve got the basics covered.\n\nYou’ll also want to factor in needs that may not be immediate but are essential to maintaining a good financial footing. This includes things like keeping an emergency fund and a rainy day fund. Also, consider whether it makes sense to pay off your mortgage faster or start investing. While these aren’t urgent expenses, they’re important for building a more secure financial future.\n\nExamples of wants in personal finance\n\nOn the other hand, financial wants are those extra purchases that aren’t necessary for survival but make life more enjoyable. Take, for instance, setting aside a little each month for ice cream. As long as your essential expenses are covered, there’s nothing wrong with indulging in a treat like this.\n\nCommon wants include:\n\nDining out\n\nEntertainment\n\nLeisure activities\n\nNon-essential purchases (like gadgets or designer clothing)\n\nTravel\n\nWhile wants can enhance your quality of life, they should be managed within the constraints of a budget to avoid overextending yourself.\n\nCan a need also be a want?\n\nNeeds and wants aren’t always mutually exclusive. A need can also be a want when it fulfills the necessity for survival and safety as well as the desire for comfort or enjoyment.\n\nFor example, housing provides essential shelter, but the type of housing chosen may also cater to your individual preferences for amenities or location. Likewise, while nutritious food is necessary for sustenance, your preferences for dining and cuisine can also influence food choices.\n\nIn essence, when an expense serves both a fundamental need and a personal preference, it qualifies as both a need and a want, blurring the distinction between them. Recognizing these dual aspects can help you make balanced decisions with your budget and expense priorities.\n\nHow to budget for wants and needs\n\nA popular budgeting method that balances needs and wants is the 50/30/20 rule. Under this framework, you allocate 50 percent of your income toward needs, 30 percent toward wants and 20 percent toward savings or debt repayment. This approach ensures that essential expenses are covered before discretionary spending and savings goals.\n\nStart by listing all your monthly expenses and categorizing them as needs or wants. Fixed expenses like rent or mortgage payments fall under needs, while variable expenses like dining out or shopping fall under wants. Allocate your income accordingly, ensuring that essential needs are prioritized before discretionary wants.\n\nHere’s an example budget for a fixed income of $3,000 based on the 50/30/20 rule:\n\n    Needs: $1,500 (50 percent)\n\nCaret Down Icon\n\nRent: $800\n\nUtilities (electricity, water, gas): $150\n\nGroceries: $300\n\nTransportation (public transit, gas, maintenance): $200\n\nHealth insurance: $50\n\n    Wants: $900 (30 percent)\n\nCaret Down Icon\n\nDining out: $200\n\nEntertainment (movies, concerts, streaming services): $100\n\nShopping (clothing, gadgets): $300\n\nTravel: $200\n\n    Savings/Debt Repayment: $600 (20 percent)\n\nCaret Down Icon\n\nEmergency fund: $200\n\nRetirement savings (401(k), IRA): $200\n\nDebt repayment (Credit cards, loans): $200\n\nTotal Expenses: $3,000\n\n            Dollar Icon\n\n                Of course, you can make adjustments based on your circumstances and priorities. To set your own customized zero-based 50/30/20 budget, you can use Bankrate’s budget sheet.\n\nPractical tips to decide if an item is a need or a want\n\nWhen faced with gray areas like deciding on major purchases such as a car, it’s essential to approach the decision-making process with clarity.\n\nAsk yourself the following questions:\n\nIs it helpful for my daily life?\n\nCan I afford it without sacrificing essentials?\n\nAre there more economical alternatives that could help me achieve the same outcome?\n\nDoes it align with my long-term goals?\n\nFirst, decide if the item serves a fundamental purpose in your life. Reliable transportation for work or family obligations would be a great example. However, you may or may not have access to a less expensive alternative like public transportation or a used vehicle.\n\nNext, assess whether paying for a product or service would compromise essential needs like housing, utilities or health care. Make sure the purchase fits comfortably within your budget and look for alternatives that might cost less.\n\nFinally, consider how the item or experience fits into your overall financial plan. Will it contribute to your well-being and long-term financial stability, or does it represent a desire for convenience or luxury?\n\nBy approaching gray areas with practical considerations, you can make decisions that balance wants with essential needs and support your financial health and long-term goals.\n\nHow to simplify the prioritization process\n\nWhen overwhelmed by multiple financial goals, it helps to simplify your approach: identify the most pressing or beneficial goal and dedicate your efforts there first. This focused strategy helps prevent distraction and makes it easier to achieve success one step at a time.\n\nWhen introducing a new financial habit or routine, anticipate the needed commitment. Decide in advance what you’re willing to sacrifice to accommodate it. For example, to save more, consider cutting back on dining out or entertainment expenses. Or, if you already have an established financial routine, pinpoint an aspect to prioritize.\n\nFor instance, if you’re budgeting, you might prioritize allocating a larger portion toward debt repayment or emergency savings.\n\nAs you make plans, make sure to stick with at least minimum payments on any debts you have. Keep an eye on your credit report, dispute incorrect items as necessary and consider working with a credit repair company if you’ve fallen significantly behind.\n\nNext steps\n\nUnderstanding the difference between needs and wants will help you make choices that support your financial health and stability. These concepts might blur together in casual chats, but when it comes to spending decisions, recognizing the difference is a key to smart financial management.\n\nStart by looking closely at where your money goes each month. Use a budgeting approach like the 50/30/20 rule to distribute your income wisely.

Maybe you were passively scrolling through your social media feed when a sponsored post came up, showcasing the latest tech gadget with glowing reviews. Unable to resist, you clicked the “buy” button for fear of missing out, only to find the excitement faded not long after, leaving you with regret and a dent in your bank account.\n\nWhat is impulse buying?\n\nImpulse buying is the act of making unplanned purchases on a whim without considering long-term goals and needs. From flashy tech to trendy fashion items, impulse purchases can quickly drain your bank account and hinder your long-term financial goals.\n\nThe temptation is further fueled by social media — 48 percent of social media users have made an impulse purchase, according to Bankrate’s Social Media Survey. And 68 percent of those said they regretted an impulse purchase they made on social media.\n\nCoupled with the current high-inflation environment, succumbing to impulse purchases can have even more detrimental effects on our savings than usual. But there are ways you can curb impulsive spending habits and focus on more long-term financial goals.\n\nStrategies to stop impulse buying\n\n1. Reflect before purchasing\n\nGetting into the habit of slowing down and reflecting before making an impulse buy can be a big money-saver.\n\nSome questions you should ask yourself:\n\nIs this item a want or a need?\n\nCan I afford it without sacrificing something more important?\n\nWill this bring long-term value and satisfaction?\n\n2. Stick to a shopping list\n\nBefore heading to the store or browsing online, make a shopping list of items that you genuinely need. A shopping list provides a clear plan for your shopping trip, eliminating ambiguity and reducing the chances of being swayed by impulses. It also acts as a reminder of your goals and priorities.\n\nYou could try using a shopping list app which can help you organize your shopping lists and even share them with friends or family members to streamline your shopping process.\n\n3. Implement the 24-hour rule\n\nWhen you come across something you’re tempted to buy immediately, give yourself a cooling-off period of 24 hours. Why? The purpose of the 24-hour rule is to create a space between the initial impulse and the actual purchase — often, the initial excitement and compulsion to buy can fade after that time period. By waiting, you give yourself a chance to reconsider the purchase in a more neutral state of mind.\n\nDuring those 24 hours, you can take the time to research the item’s features, read reviews, compare prices and consider if it aligns with your needs and budget.\n\n4. Unfollow accounts that fuel your temptation\n\nThe constant stream of captivating images, flashy ads and influencers promoting products on social media can make it incredibly tempting to click that “buy now” button without a second thought. With just a swipe or a scroll, we’re exposed to a never-ending array of products and services, each promising to improve our lives in some way. But that promise can be deceiving and succumbing to the temptation can lead to financial stress and instability.\n\nOne big step you can take to help resist the siren call of impulse buys is to carefully curate your social media feed to prevent yourself from seeing those items in the first place. Unfollow brands and promoters that consistently tempt you. You might even want to remove certain shopping apps from your phone or set time limits for those that have the strongest pull on you. Even a few changes to your social media feed can reduce the constant exposure to shopping triggers and help you save money.\n\n5. Prioritize clear financial goals for long-term gratification\n\nEnvision your ideal financial future, and set clear goals. Instead of simply saying you want to save money, set a specific target, such as saving $5,000 within the next year. Once you’ve established goals, you can fit them into your budget to align your spending with what you want to achieve in the long term.\n\nIt’s easy to give in to temporary pleasures when we’re surrounded by lures to buy stuff all the time, but reminding yourself of your financial goals and learning to wait can help you find long-term fulfillment. As you achieve smaller milestones toward your goals, reward yourself (within reason) to maintain a positive mindset and reinforce your commitment to the larger goals.\n\n6. Pay with cash\n\nTake the time to budget exactly how much you can spend on your purchases and withdraw cash to spend on those purchases. By using cash, you avoid overspending and impulse purchases.\n\nIf you’re used to paying with a card to rack up credit card points or cashback rewards, you’ll lose out on these benefits when you pay with cash. But once you start to gain more discipline by paying with cash, you might be able to transition back to responsible credit card use.\n\nBe aware of signs of impulsive spending habits\n\nThe thrill of impulsive buying might not show up right away, but there are some signs to look out for, including:\n\nYou’re spending beyond your means or more than you intended during your purchase.\n\nYou hide purchases from family members or a partner.\n\nYou’re unable to pay bills or save as much as you’d like because of high spending elsewhere.\n\nYou feel guilty or regretful about spending.\n\nBottom line\n\nBy establishing clear financial goals and prioritizing your long-term needs over short-term impulse purchases, you can regain control of your finances and make decisions that support future aspirations. Keep track of how much you’ve saved from cutting back on impulse buying — those savings can go toward a specific savings fund or be invested in a high-yielding certificate of deposit (CD) to earn money back in the form of interest.\n\nEdit Icon\n    \n      Cite us\n\nShare Icon\n        \n            Share this article\n\nShare Icon\n            \n                Share this article\n\n                        Facebook Icon\n\n                        Twitter Icon\n\n                        LinkedIn Icon\n\n                        Email Envelope Icon\n\n                        Close\n\n                Written by\n\n                René Bennett\n                \n                    Arrow Right Icon\n\n                Banking writer\n\n                    Read more from Rene\n\n            René Bennett is a former writer for Bankrate, reporting on banking products and personal finance.\n\nExplore our top credit card picks\n\n          ×\n\nSelect a category:\n\n              Balance transfer →\n\n              Cash back →\n\n              0% Intro APR →\n\n              Business →\n\n              Best credit cards →\n\n    You may also like\n\n                        How to handle the volatile stock market if you’re about to retire\n\n                        Retirement\n\n                                By James Royal, Ph.D.\n\n5 min read\n\n                        Top CD Rates Today: October 2, 2024\n\n                        Banking\n\n                        8 best credit cards for groceries for November 2024\n\n                        Credit Cards\n\n                        From Posts to Overspending: Is Social Media Wrecking Your Finances?

Our scale goes from 1.0 at the bottom to 5.0 at the top and is incremented in tenths of a star — such as 2.5, 3.7 or 5.0.\n\nHow ratings are set\n\nRatings for cash back cards are determined by a proprietary formula developed by NerdWallet’s credit card experts. The formula calculates how much cash back a typical consumer might expect to earn by using the card as their primary payment method, as well as how much the card would cost the user in fees. The formula also takes into account the value of additional card perks, how easy it is to earn and redeem rewards, the simplicity of the cash back structure, and other factors.\n\nLearn more about how NerdWallet rates credit cards here.\n\nWhat the stars mean\n\nGenerally speaking, a 5.0 rating indicates that this is a best-in-class card that would provide substantial value to just about anyone, while a 1.0 rating indicates that this card would be a poor value for just about anyone. In the middle, a 3.0 rating represents decent value — most people will come out ahead, but they might be able to do better with a different card.\n\nA five-star cash back card is not a “perfect” card, however, because an objectively perfect card doesn’t exist. Every consumer has different needs, and each cash back credit card delivers value to consumers through a unique combination of features. Depending on your situation, a card that earns an overall rating of, say, 4.0 or 3.5 might actually be the perfect card for you.\n\nRewards structure\n\nThe single biggest consideration for most people looking for a cash back credit card is how much cash back they can earn. Also important, though, is how much work they have to do to earn that cash back.\n\nSome cards pay a single “flat” rate on all purchases. Others pay higher rates in select bonus categories. Further, some cards with bonus categories change them up periodically, let you choose your own categories, or even adjust rewards rates automatically based on your spending. The simplicity (or complexity) of the rewards structure is a factor in NerdWallet’s ratings.\n\nBonus categories\n\nMost people spend far more money at grocery stores than they do at, say, drugstores, so earning 3% at supermarkets will usually be worth more to a consumer than earning 3% (or even higher) at the drugstore. Our ratings formula takes these kinds of differences into account, drawing on federal consumer spending data to assess the relative value of bonus categories.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that what really matters is how you spend money. All other things being equal, a card that earns 5% at the supermarket will get a higher star rating than one that earns 5% at the drugstore — but if you’re looking for a card to use at the drugstore, then the latter card might be your personal five-star option.\n\nFees, perks and more\n\nOur formula weighs the rewards you earn on a credit card against the costs of carrying that card. Most cash back cards don’t charge an annual fee, but for those that do, you should be getting outsized value that more than makes up for the fee.\n\nWe also assess the value of any perks that come with the card, such as a sign-up bonus, automatic credits for certain spending or a 0% introductory APR offer that can save you interest on a big purchase. And we consider such things as the issuer’s customer service record and how hard it is to qualify for the card.\n\nHow ratings are set\n\nWhat the stars mean\n\nRewards structure\n\nBonus categories\n\nFees, perks and more\n\nRatings for cash back cards are determined by a proprietary formula developed by NerdWallet’s credit card experts.

Groceries are a major line item for our family of four, so the Citi Custom Cash® Card is our designated card for supermarket sweeps. Dining out is a close second, and those expenses typically go on the Chase Freedom Unlimited®. If either grocery stores or restaurants happens to be in the quarterly bonus categories for Chase or Discover, then I reach for my Chase Freedom Flex® or my Discover it® Cash Back. For &quot;all else,&quot; it's usually my Citi Double Cash® Card.\n\nKenley Young\n\nAssigning editor\n\nFunto Omojola\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nThe best cash back card for me is one that earns a high flat rate for all my spending, so I don't have to juggle many cards or keep track of multiple bonus rewards categories. I use a credit card for nearly every purchase, so it gives me the peace of mind knowing I can pull out one card and earn rewards regardless of what I use it for.\n\nFunto Omojola\n\nLead writer\n\nClaire Tsosie\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nI use the Citi Double Cash® Card, which I got in 2015, for almost all of my purchases. When it came out, I remember wondering if it would stick around for long because the rewards rate seemed too high (and at the time, higher than all the other offers). It changed some details but it's basically the same as when I got it. It's helped me earned thousands in rewards over the years without any fancy strategies. At times, I've juggled dozens of credit cards and been a super-optimizer, but this is a card that I come back to when I don't want to deal with all that.\n\nClaire Tsosie\n\nAssigning editor\n\nSara Rathner\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nI use both cash back and travel rewards cards. I always pay attention to the 5% categories for the original Chase Freedom® since I can transfer those points over to my Chase Sapphire Reserve® and redeem them at a rate of 1.5 cents each for travel later on. I also carry a Citi Double Cash® Card for those &quot;everything else&quot; purchases that aren't the usual rewards categories - things like co-pays at the doctor, or vet bills. I also have a Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card (no longer available), which is my go-to dining card because it earns 4% cash back at restaurants.\n\nSara Rathner\n\nSenior writer/spokesperson\n\nKenley Young\n\nFunto Omojola\n\nClaire Tsosie\n\nSara Rathner\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nI carry about a half-dozen cash-back credit cards, and each has a specific use case.

I also have a Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card (no longer available), which is my go-to dining card because it earns 4% cash back at restaurants.\n\nSara Rathner\n\nSenior writer/spokesperson\n\nASK REDDIT: WHAT’S THE BEST CASH BACK CARD?\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nReddit users who frequent the site's personal finance forums, particularly r/CreditCards, know that requests for credit card recommendations come up on a daily if not hourly basis. These requests are so common that r/CreditCards asks users to fill out a detailed template with enough information to help other redditors make an appropriate recommendation.\n\nThe credit cards subreddit has scores of threads asking some variation of the question &quot;What's the best cash back credit card?&quot; The answers tend to be all over the map — as they should be, since the &quot;best&quot; cash back credit card for you (or anyone) is very much dependent on your individual circumstances. In one of these discussions, a user summed up the point pretty much the same way NerdWallet does:\n\n&quot;Depends on where you spend your cash &amp; how much it is. One card doesn't fit everyone's needs or wants.&quot;\n\n— Reddit user Eli-Had-A-Book-\n\nFor example, in a post from spring 2024 (the source of the comment shown above), a redditor asked for the &quot;best cash back card in 2024,&quot; with their only parameters being no &quot;hoops&quot; to jump through and no rotating categories. The thread attracted 208 comments before being archived, and those comments touched on more than 30 distinct cards. Some were cited more than others, but the sheer variety of the suggestions reflects the many ways in which people use cash back cards. For example:\n\nFor those who value simplicity, multiple users suggested getting a good flat-rate card like the Citi Double Cash® Card (the card that came up most frequently in that discussion), the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, the Fidelity® Rewards Visa Signature® Card or the PayPal Cashback Mastercard® and then putting all spending on that card.\n\nOther redditors recommended cards that offer supercharged rewards when used in specific ways. For example, the Kroger Rewards World Elite Mastercard, from the Kroger supermarket conglomerate, pays 5% cash back on purchases made with mobile wallets. With so many merchants now able to take mobile wallet payments, some users view this card as giving them 5% on everything. The amount of spending eligible for 5% has an annual cap, though, so some users said they have more than one account, giving them a higher cap.\n\nUsers who are members of the Bank of America® Preferred Rewards program rave about the high cash back rates they're able to earn on that issuer's cards thanks to rewards bonuses of up to 75%.\n\nA separate discussion in fall 2024 started with a question, &quot;What is the BEST cash back card for EVERYTHING?&quot; After 117 comments, users had tossed around more than 30 options there, too. And looking back at similar threads over the years, the pattern is the same.\n\nWorth noting: The r/CreditCards subreddit is popular with card hackers who might carry a dozen or more cards and excel at squeezing maximum rewards out of them all, so it's common to see suggestions that point to fairly obscure cash back cards or even travel rewards credit cards whose points can be turned into cash with strategic redemption. A post asking for recommendations for a single cash back card that someone can use for every purchase will commonly draw responses encouraging the user to expand their horizons and combine two or more options to enhance their earning.\n\nSo what's Reddit's favorite cash back credit card? It doesn't have one. While r/CreditCards maintains comprehensive lists of cards that earn good cash back in common categories, it isn't going to pick a &quot;winner.&quot; Reddit is a huge community of individuals. The r/CreditCards subreddit had 1.4 million members as of September 2024, while r/personalfinance had 20 million. You're never going to get a single definitive answer, because every response is coming from a different individual who has found what works for them. But because so many people are participating, Reddit users offer up a lot of different scenarios that might match your situation, which means the recommendations that accompany those scenarios may have value to you.\n\nHere are threads that Reddit's algorithm has highlighted for discussions about the &quot;best&quot; cash back cards in popular categories:\n\nGroceries (or see more discussions).\n\nGas (or see more discussions).\n\nRestaurants (or see more discussions).\n\nTravel (or see more discussions).\n\n&quot;Everything&quot; (or see more discussions).\n\nMOST POPULAR CASH BACK CREDIT CARDS\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nNerdWallet’s credit card experts have reviewed hundreds of credit cards. These are the most visited review pages for cash back credit cards.\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited®\n\nApple Card\n\nCapital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card\n\nPrime Visa\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash® Card\n\nBlue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express\n\nBlue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express\n\nCiti Double Cash® Card\n\nCapital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card\n\nCiti Custom Cash® Card\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nNerdWallet's Credit Cards team selects the best cash-back credit cards based on overall consumer value, as evidenced by star ratings, as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers. Factors in our evaluation include each card's cash-back earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or tiered categories), annual fee, redemption options (including minimum redemption amounts), promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one's own rewards categories. Learn how NerdWallet rates credit cards.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nHow do cash-back credit cards work?\n\nEvery time you use a cash-back credit card, the card issuer &quot;pays you back&quot; a certain percentage of the purchase amount. For example, if your card earns 2% cash back on all purchases, and you buy something for $80, then you would earn $1.60 in cash back. Or say your card earns 5% at the gas station; in that case, a $42 fill-up would earn $2.10.\n\nWith most cash-back cards, you can see your accumulated earnings on your monthly statement or through your online account portal, and you can decide when and how to redeem your cash back. Some cards automatically apply your cash back to your account as a credit.\n\nDo cash-back cards actually give you cash?\n\n&quot;Cash back&quot; doesn't mean the card issuer sends you an envelope full of dollar bills. But the rewards do ultimately leave you with more cash in your pocket. The simplest way to redeem cash back is to take it as a credit that reduces your account balance: Redeem $50 worth of cash back, and a $325 balance becomes $275. Many cards also allow you to redeem cash back as a direct deposit into a bank account, and some will even mail you a paper check if you request it.\n\nEvery card issuer has its own rules for how you can redeem cash back. Some have a minimum redemption requirement — you might not be able to cash in your rewards until you have accumulated at least $20 or $25. Others let you redeem any amount at any time.\n\nWhat kinds of cash-back credit cards are there?\n\nThere are two basic kinds of cash-back credit cards:\n\nFlat-rate cards pay the same cash-back rate no matter what you buy. Flat-rate cards typically pay 1.5% to 2% on everything.\n\nBonus category cards pay higher rates (as much as 5% or 6%) at specific types of merchants, such as grocery stores or restaurants, and a lower rate (usually 1%) everywhere else.\n\nBonus categories themselves come in different flavors. On a lot of cards, the bonus categories never change. For example, you might always earn 3% at restaurants or 5% at gas stations. Some cards have rotating categories that change every three months, and you need to &quot;activate&quot; the categories online to qualify for the higher rate. And some cards have customizable bonus categories — you can choose which purchases earn higher rewards, or the card automatically adjusts to give you higher rewards in the category where you spend the most money.\n\nIt's common (though by no means universal) for bonus category cards to cap the amount of spending that qualifies for their highest rates; once you hit the cap, any spending in those categories reverts to the card's lower &quot;everywhere else&quot; rate. In general, cash back cards don't limit the total amount of cash back you can earn, although there are some exceptions.\n\nWhat's the highest-paying cash-back card?\n\nEveryone's spending patterns are different, so the card that earns you the most cash back depends on your individual situation. If you spend far more money eating out than at home, for example, a card that pays 3% at restaurants would likely be a better fit than one that pays 6% at supermarkets.\n\nIs cash back from a credit card taxable?\n\nLegally speaking, credit card rewards are treated as discounts on purchases rather than as income. That means you don't owe any taxes on your cash back.\n\nDoes cash back expire?\n\nCash back rewards typically do not expire as long as your account remains open and active. (Exceptions may apply, so check your card agreement.) Some cards may automatically apply your cash back as a credit against purchases on your next statement; others let you save it up and use it when you want.\n\nShould I save up cash back rewards?\n\nFrom a purely financial standpoint, the best way to use cash back is to redeem it as soon as it is received. Cash back doesn't earn interest, so inflation erodes its value as it sits unredeemed. If you want to put the money into savings, redeem it as a direct deposit into a bank account rather than let it build up. If that's not an option, redeem for statement credit and then put an equal amount into savings.\n\nThat said, it's not a catastrophic error to let your rewards balance build toward a goal — a big purchase, a trip, whatever. Just have a goal in mind, and don't let it sit for years on end.\n\nWhy do credit cards give cash back?\n\nCredit card issuers give you cash back because doing so encourages you to use their cards. Credit card issuers make money from three main sources:\n\nFees paid by cardholders, including annual fees, late fees, balance transfer fees and so on.\n\nInterest.\n\nTransaction fees paid by merchants who accept credit cards, often referred to as &quot;interchange.&quot;\n\nMost cash back cards don't charge annual fees. So in most cases, the only way the card issuer is going to make money off a cash back card is if the cardholder uses the card — and uses it enough that the fees and interest collected by the issuer outweigh the rewards it pays out. Cardholders can make the math work in their favor by paying their bill in full and on time each month. When you do that, you don't incur interest on purchases and you never pay late fees.\n\nAbout the author\n\nJae Bratton\n\nJae is a writer for the credit cards team at NerdWallet.

She previously worked at Bankrate and has been interviewed as an expert on credit and credit cards by such outlets as CNBC, Business Insider and International Business Times.\n\nSee full bio.\n\n+  more \n\n» This card is no longer available\n\nThe PenFed Promise Visa® Card is no longer accepting new applications. For other options, see our best balance transfer credit cards or explore our list of the best PenFed credit cards.\n\nIn a market where issuers dangle flashy rewards, juicy sign-up bonuses and other eye-catching extras to entice you, the PenFed Promise Visa® Card can seem pretty pedestrian.\n\nBut there's nothing wrong with keeping things simple, and sometimes basic can be better. As a cost-conscious option, the PenFed Promise Visa® Card stands tall among its peers for what it doesn’t have: There's no annual fee to carry the card, no foreign transaction fee and, crucially, no balance transfer fee.\n\nHere's what else you should know about the PenFed Promise Visa® Card.\n\n» MORE: NerdWallet's best balance transfer credit cards\n\n1. Membership is required, but anyone can join\n\nLike most credit unions, PenFed requires that you become a member to apply for and use any of its financial products. But PenFed has relaxed its eligibility requirements. You no longer need to be related to a member, nor do you have to be affiliated with (or make a donation to) any particular organization.\n\nTo become a PenFed credit union member, just fill out the basic information form, open a required minimum $5 savings account, and you’re in.\n\n» MORE: NerdWallet's best credit union credit cards\n\n2. It's a good pick for a balance transfer card\n\nWhen you’re looking to transfer debt from a high-interest credit card, you typically have a choice: You can pick a card that offers the longest available terms (ideally at a 0% intro APR), or you can opt for a card that charges the lowest fees to make a balance transfer. The PenFed Promise Visa® Card offers a twist on these options. There’s no balance transfer fee, but there's also no 0% introductory APR period, either.\n\nAs of this writing, the card's ongoing APR was still lower than the double-digit interest rates charged by many other credit cards, and it landed the card a spot on our list of the best no balance transfer fee credit cards.\n\nBut it pays to do the math. Long term, it could be cheaper to pick another card with a 0% intro offer if what you’ll save on interest payments overall is greater than what you’ll pay upfront for the balance transfer fee.\n\n» MORE: How to choose a balance transfer card\n\n3. There are no ongoing rewards ...\n\nYou won't earn ongoing rewards on everyday purchases with the PenFed Promise Visa® Card. So if you aren't looking to transfer a balance — and assuming you always pay your bills in full and on time — you’d benefit more from a rewards card that can snag you cash back or points.\n\n» MORE: How to choose a rewards credit card\n\n4. ... But there is a sign-up offer\n\nThat's not to say there's no upfront rewards incentive at all. Somewhat oddly, while the PenFed Promise Visa® Card doesn't earn ongoing rewards, it does offer new members a sign-up bonus.\n\nThat may not be the best credit card bonus offer around, but it's relatively attainable.\n\n5. No penalty APR or late fees\n\nSometimes things happen and you miss or skip a payment. If this sounds like you, the PenFed Promise Visa® Card’s forgiving nature could be appealing. There are no late fees and no penalty APRs — although paying late can still affect your credit scores.\n\nAbout the author\n\nRobin Saks Frankel\n\nRobin is a former credit cards writer for NerdWallet.

Instead, they use a mortgage, which is a loan to buy a home. After making a down payment of anywhere from 3% to 25%, they get a mortgage to cover the remaining costs of purchasing the home.\n\nA mortgage is set up so you pay off the loan over a specified period called the term. The most popular term is 30 years. Each payment includes a combination of principal and interest, as well as property taxes, and, if needed, mortgage insurance. (Homeowners insurance may be included, or the homeowner may pay the insurer directly.) Principal is the original amount of money you borrowed while interest is what you're being charged to borrow the money.\n\n» MORE: Estimate your monthly mortgage payment\n\nWATCH: Mortgage rates explained\n\nHow do mortgage rates work?\n\nThe mortgage rate a lender offers you is determined by a mix of factors that are specific to you and larger forces that are beyond your control.\n\nLenders will have a base rate that takes the big stuff into account and gives them some profit. They adjust that base rate up or down for individual borrowers depending on perceived risk. If you seem like a safe bet to a lender, you're more likely to be offered a lower interest rate.\n\nFactors you can change:\n\nYour credit score. Mortgage lenders use credit scores to evaluate risk. Higher scores are seen as safer. In other words, the lender is more confident that you'll successfully make your mortgage payments.\n\nYour down payment. Paying a larger percentage of the home's price upfront reduces the amount you're borrowing and makes you seem less risky to lenders. You can calculate your loan-to-value ratio to check this out. A LTV of 80% or more is considered high.\n\nYour loan type. The kind of loan you're applying for can influence the mortgage rate you're offered. For example, jumbo loans tend to have higher interest rates.\n\nHow you're using the home. Mortgages for primary residences — a place you're actually going to live — generally get lower interest rates than home loans for vacation properties, second homes or investment properties.\n\nForces you can't control:\n\nThe U.S. economy. Sure, this means Wall Street, but non-market forces (for example, elections) can also influence mortgage rates. Changes in inflation and unemployment rates tend to put pressure on interest rates.\n\nThe global economy. What's happening around the world will influence U.S. markets. Global political worries can move mortgage rates lower. Good news may push rates higher.\n\nThe Federal Reserve. The nation’s central bank attempts to guide the economy with the twin goals of encouraging job growth while keeping inflation under control. Decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee to raise or cut short-term interest rates can sometimes cause lenders to raise or cut mortgage rates.\n\n» MORE: What determines mortgage rates?\n\nHow (and why) to compare mortgage rates\n\nMortgage rates like the ones you see on this page are sample rates. In this case, they're the averages of rates from multiple lenders, which are provided to NerdWallet by Zillow. They let you know about where mortgage rates stand today, but they might not reflect the rate you'll be offered.\n\nWhen you look at an individual lender's website and see mortgage rates, those are also sample rates. To generate those rates, the lender will use a bunch of assumptions about their “sample” borrower, including credit score, location and down payment amount. Sample rates also sometimes include discount points, which are optional fees borrowers can pay to lower the interest rate. Including discount points will make a lender's rates appear lower.\n\nTo see more personalized rates, you'll need to provide some information about you and about the home you want to buy. For example, at the top of this page, you can enter your ZIP code to start comparing rates. On the next page, you can adjust your approximate credit score, the amount you're looking to spend, your down payment amount and the loan term to see rate quotes that better reflect your individual situation.\n\nWhether you're looking at sample rates on lenders' websites or comparing personalized rates here, you'll notice that interest rates vary. This is one reason why it's important to shop around when you're looking for a mortgage lender. Fractions of a percentage might not seem like they'd make a big difference, but you aren't just shaving a few bucks off your monthly mortgage payment, you're also lowering the total amount of interest you'll pay over the life of the loan.\n\nIt's a good idea to apply for mortgage preapproval from at least three lenders. With a preapproval, the lenders verify some of the details of your finances, so both the rates offered and the amount you're able to borrow will be real numbers. Each lender will provide you with a Loan Estimate. These standardized forms make it easy to compare interest rates as well as lender fees.\n\nWhen you're comparing rates, you'll usually see two numbers — the interest rate and the APR. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is usually the higher of the two because it takes into account both the interest rate and the other costs associated with the loan (like those lender fees). Because of this, APR is usually considered a more accurate measure of the cost of borrowing.\n\n» MORE FOR CANADIAN READERS: Best mortgage rates in Canada\n\nMORTGAGE RATES FAQS\n\nWhat's the difference between interest rate and APR?\n\nThe interest rate is the percentage that the lender charges for borrowing the money. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is supposed to reflect a more accurate cost of borrowing. The APR calculation includes fees and discount points, along with the interest rate.\n\nAPR is a tool used to compare loan offers, even if they have different interest rates, fees and discount points. APR takes ongoing costs like mortgage insurance into account, which is why it's usually higher than the interest rate.\n\nWhat is a discount point?\n\nDiscount points are basically prepaid interest that reduces the interest rate on your mortgage. One discount point costs 1% of the loan amount, and will usually drop the interest rate by 0.25%.\n\nBuying points is optional. Be on the lookout for them, as a lender may add points to a loan offer to make their interest rate seem more competitive. It's up to you to decide if paying for points as part of your closing costs is worth it.\n\nThe impact of a 0.25% change in the interest rate depends on the loan amount, the term and the interest rates. To illustrate, let's look at a $250,000 mortgage with a 30-year term, and the differences in payment between an interest rate of 4% and a rate of 4.25%.\n\nAt 4%, the monthly principal and interest cost $1,193.54. At 4.25%, the monthly principal and interest cost $1,229.85. So, for a $250,000 mortgage with a 30-year term, cutting the interest rate from 4.25% to 4% saves $36.31 a month and $436 a year.\n\n» MORE: Mortgage points calculator\n\nWhat is a mortgage rate lock?\n\nMortgage rates not only vary from day to day, but hour to hour. In order to know what rate you'll pay, you need the rate you're offered to stop changing. A mortgage rate lock is the lender's guarantee that you'll pay the agreed-upon interest rate if you close by a certain date. Your locked rate won't change, no matter what happens to interest rates in the meantime.\n\nIt's a good idea to lock the rate when you're approved for a mortgage with an interest rate that you're comfortable with. Consult with your loan officer on the timing of the rate lock. Ideally, your rate lock would extend a few days after the expected closing date, so you'll get the agreed-upon rate even if the closing is delayed a few days.\n\nAbout the author: Kate Wood is a mortgages and student loans writer and spokesperson who joined NerdWallet in 2019.

Our scale goes from 1.0 at the bottom to 5.0 at the top and is incremented in tenths of a star — such as 2.5, 3.7 or 5.0.\n\nHow ratings are set\n\nRatings for cash back cards are determined by a proprietary formula developed by NerdWallet’s credit card experts. The formula calculates how much cash back a typical consumer might expect to earn by using the card as their primary payment method, as well as how much the card would cost the user in fees. The formula also takes into account the value of additional card perks, how easy it is to earn and redeem rewards, the simplicity of the cash back structure, and other factors.\n\nLearn more about how NerdWallet rates credit cards here.\n\nWhat the stars mean\n\nGenerally speaking, a 5.0 rating indicates that this is a best-in-class card that would provide substantial value to just about anyone, while a 1.0 rating indicates that this card would be a poor value for just about anyone. In the middle, a 3.0 rating represents decent value — most people will come out ahead, but they might be able to do better with a different card.\n\nA five-star cash back card is not a “perfect” card, however, because an objectively perfect card doesn’t exist. Every consumer has different needs, and each cash back credit card delivers value to consumers through a unique combination of features. Depending on your situation, a card that earns an overall rating of, say, 4.0 or 3.5 might actually be the perfect card for you.\n\nRewards structure\n\nThe single biggest consideration for most people looking for a cash back credit card is how much cash back they can earn. Also important, though, is how much work they have to do to earn that cash back.\n\nSome cards pay a single “flat” rate on all purchases. Others pay higher rates in select bonus categories. Further, some cards with bonus categories change them up periodically, let you choose your own categories, or even adjust rewards rates automatically based on your spending. The simplicity (or complexity) of the rewards structure is a factor in NerdWallet’s ratings.\n\nBonus categories\n\nMost people spend far more money at grocery stores than they do at, say, drugstores, so earning 3% at supermarkets will usually be worth more to a consumer than earning 3% (or even higher) at the drugstore. Our ratings formula takes these kinds of differences into account, drawing on federal consumer spending data to assess the relative value of bonus categories.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that what really matters is how you spend money. All other things being equal, a card that earns 5% at the supermarket will get a higher star rating than one that earns 5% at the drugstore — but if you’re looking for a card to use at the drugstore, then the latter card might be your personal five-star option.\n\nFees, perks and more\n\nOur formula weighs the rewards you earn on a credit card against the costs of carrying that card. Most cash back cards don’t charge an annual fee, but for those that do, you should be getting outsized value that more than makes up for the fee.\n\nWe also assess the value of any perks that come with the card, such as a sign-up bonus, automatic credits for certain spending or a 0% introductory APR offer that can save you interest on a big purchase. And we consider such things as the issuer’s customer service record and how hard it is to qualify for the card.\n\nHow ratings are set\n\nWhat the stars mean\n\nRewards structure\n\nBonus categories\n\nFees, perks and more\n\nRatings for cash back cards are determined by a proprietary formula developed by NerdWallet’s credit card experts.

Groceries are a major line item for our family of four, so the Citi Custom Cash® Card is our designated card for supermarket sweeps. Dining out is a close second, and those expenses typically go on the Chase Freedom Unlimited®. If either grocery stores or restaurants happens to be in the quarterly bonus categories for Chase or Discover, then I reach for my Chase Freedom Flex® or my Discover it® Cash Back. For &quot;all else,&quot; it's usually my Citi Double Cash® Card.\n\nKenley Young\n\nAssigning editor\n\nFunto Omojola\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nThe best cash back card for me is one that earns a high flat rate for all my spending, so I don't have to juggle many cards or keep track of multiple bonus rewards categories. I use a credit card for nearly every purchase, so it gives me the peace of mind knowing I can pull out one card and earn rewards regardless of what I use it for.\n\nFunto Omojola\n\nLead writer\n\nClaire Tsosie\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nI use the Citi Double Cash® Card, which I got in 2015, for almost all of my purchases. When it came out, I remember wondering if it would stick around for long because the rewards rate seemed too high (and at the time, higher than all the other offers). It changed some details but it's basically the same as when I got it. It's helped me earned thousands in rewards over the years without any fancy strategies. At times, I've juggled dozens of credit cards and been a super-optimizer, but this is a card that I come back to when I don't want to deal with all that.\n\nClaire Tsosie\n\nAssigning editor\n\nSara Rathner\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nI use both cash back and travel rewards cards. I always pay attention to the 5% categories for the original Chase Freedom® since I can transfer those points over to my Chase Sapphire Reserve® and redeem them at a rate of 1.5 cents each for travel later on. I also carry a Citi Double Cash® Card for those &quot;everything else&quot; purchases that aren't the usual rewards categories - things like co-pays at the doctor, or vet bills. I also have a Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card (no longer available), which is my go-to dining card because it earns 4% cash back at restaurants.\n\nSara Rathner\n\nSenior writer/spokesperson\n\nKenley Young\n\nFunto Omojola\n\nClaire Tsosie\n\nSara Rathner\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nI carry about a half-dozen cash-back credit cards, and each has a specific use case. Groceries are a major line item for our family of four, so the Citi Custom Cash® Card is our designated card for supermarket sweeps. Dining out is a close second, and those expenses typically go on the Chase Freedom Unlimited®. If either grocery stores or restaurants happens to be in the quarterly bonus categories for Chase or Discover, then I reach for my Chase Freedom Flex® or my Discover it® Cash Back. For &quot;all else,&quot; it's usually my Citi Double Cash® Card.\n\nKenley Young\n\nAssigning editor\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nThe best cash back card for me is one that earns a high flat rate for all my spending, so I don't have to juggle many cards or keep track of multiple bonus rewards categories. I use a credit card for nearly every purchase, so it gives me the peace of mind knowing I can pull out one card and earn rewards regardless of what I use it for.\n\nFunto Omojola\n\nLead writer\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nI use the Citi Double Cash® Card, which I got in 2015, for almost all of my purchases. When it came out, I remember wondering if it would stick around for long because the rewards rate seemed too high (and at the time, higher than all the other offers). It changed some details but it's basically the same as when I got it. It's helped me earned thousands in rewards over the years without any fancy strategies. At times, I've juggled dozens of credit cards and been a super-optimizer, but this is a card that I come back to when I don't want to deal with all that.\n\nClaire Tsosie\n\nAssigning editor\n\nWHAT'S YOUR CASH BACK CREDIT CARD STRATEGY?\n\nI use both cash back and travel rewards cards. I always pay attention to the 5% categories for the original Chase Freedom® since I can transfer those points over to my Chase Sapphire Reserve® and redeem them at a rate of 1.5 cents each for travel later on. I also carry a Citi Double Cash® Card for those &quot;everything else&quot; purchases that aren't the usual rewards categories - things like co-pays at the doctor, or vet bills.

These requests are so common that r/CreditCards asks users to fill out a detailed template with enough information to help other redditors make an appropriate recommendation.\n\nThe credit cards subreddit has scores of threads asking some variation of the question &quot;What's the best cash back credit card?&quot; The answers tend to be all over the map — as they should be, since the &quot;best&quot; cash back credit card for you (or anyone) is very much dependent on your individual circumstances. In one of these discussions, a user summed up the point pretty much the same way NerdWallet does:\n\n&quot;Depends on where you spend your cash &amp; how much it is. One card doesn't fit everyone's needs or wants.&quot;\n\n— Reddit user Eli-Had-A-Book-\n\nFor example, in a post from spring 2024 (the source of the comment shown above), a redditor asked for the &quot;best cash back card in 2024,&quot; with their only parameters being no &quot;hoops&quot; to jump through and no rotating categories. The thread attracted 208 comments before being archived, and those comments touched on more than 30 distinct cards. Some were cited more than others, but the sheer variety of the suggestions reflects the many ways in which people use cash back cards. For example:\n\nFor those who value simplicity, multiple users suggested getting a good flat-rate card like the Citi Double Cash® Card (the card that came up most frequently in that discussion), the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, the Fidelity® Rewards Visa Signature® Card or the PayPal Cashback Mastercard® and then putting all spending on that card.\n\nOther redditors recommended cards that offer supercharged rewards when used in specific ways. For example, the Kroger Rewards World Elite Mastercard, from the Kroger supermarket conglomerate, pays 5% cash back on purchases made with mobile wallets. With so many merchants now able to take mobile wallet payments, some users view this card as giving them 5% on everything. The amount of spending eligible for 5% has an annual cap, though, so some users said they have more than one account, giving them a higher cap.\n\nUsers who are members of the Bank of America® Preferred Rewards program rave about the high cash back rates they're able to earn on that issuer's cards thanks to rewards bonuses of up to 75%.\n\nA separate discussion in fall 2024 started with a question, &quot;What is the BEST cash back card for EVERYTHING?&quot; After 117 comments, users had tossed around more than 30 options there, too. And looking back at similar threads over the years, the pattern is the same.\n\nWorth noting: The r/CreditCards subreddit is popular with card hackers who might carry a dozen or more cards and excel at squeezing maximum rewards out of them all, so it's common to see suggestions that point to fairly obscure cash back cards or even travel rewards credit cards whose points can be turned into cash with strategic redemption. A post asking for recommendations for a single cash back card that someone can use for every purchase will commonly draw responses encouraging the user to expand their horizons and combine two or more options to enhance their earning.\n\nSo what's Reddit's favorite cash back credit card? It doesn't have one. While r/CreditCards maintains comprehensive lists of cards that earn good cash back in common categories, it isn't going to pick a &quot;winner.&quot; Reddit is a huge community of individuals. The r/CreditCards subreddit had 1.4 million members as of September 2024, while r/personalfinance had 20 million. You're never going to get a single definitive answer, because every response is coming from a different individual who has found what works for them. But because so many people are participating, Reddit users offer up a lot of different scenarios that might match your situation, which means the recommendations that accompany those scenarios may have value to you.\n\nHere are threads that Reddit's algorithm has highlighted for discussions about the &quot;best&quot; cash back cards in popular categories:\n\nGroceries (or see more discussions).\n\nGas (or see more discussions).\n\nRestaurants (or see more discussions).\n\nTravel (or see more discussions).\n\n&quot;Everything&quot; (or see more discussions).\n\nMOST POPULAR CASH BACK CREDIT CARDS\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nNerdWallet’s credit card experts have reviewed hundreds of credit cards. These are the most visited review pages for cash back credit cards.\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited®\n\nApple Card\n\nCapital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card\n\nPrime Visa\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash® Card\n\nBlue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express\n\nBlue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express\n\nCiti Double Cash® Card\n\nCapital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card\n\nCiti Custom Cash® Card\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nNerdWallet's Credit Cards team selects the best cash-back credit cards based on overall consumer value, as evidenced by star ratings, as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers. Factors in our evaluation include each card's cash-back earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or tiered categories), annual fee, redemption options (including minimum redemption amounts), promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one's own rewards categories. Learn how NerdWallet rates credit cards.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nHow do cash-back credit cards work?\n\nEvery time you use a cash-back credit card, the card issuer &quot;pays you back&quot; a certain percentage of the purchase amount. For example, if your card earns 2% cash back on all purchases, and you buy something for $80, then you would earn $1.60 in cash back. Or say your card earns 5% at the gas station; in that case, a $42 fill-up would earn $2.10.\n\nWith most cash-back cards, you can see your accumulated earnings on your monthly statement or through your online account portal, and you can decide when and how to redeem your cash back. Some cards automatically apply your cash back to your account as a credit.\n\nDo cash-back cards actually give you cash?\n\n&quot;Cash back&quot; doesn't mean the card issuer sends you an envelope full of dollar bills. But the rewards do ultimately leave you with more cash in your pocket. The simplest way to redeem cash back is to take it as a credit that reduces your account balance: Redeem $50 worth of cash back, and a $325 balance becomes $275. Many cards also allow you to redeem cash back as a direct deposit into a bank account, and some will even mail you a paper check if you request it.\n\nEvery card issuer has its own rules for how you can redeem cash back. Some have a minimum redemption requirement — you might not be able to cash in your rewards until you have accumulated at least $20 or $25. Others let you redeem any amount at any time.\n\nWhat kinds of cash-back credit cards are there?\n\nThere are two basic kinds of cash-back credit cards:\n\nFlat-rate cards pay the same cash-back rate no matter what you buy. Flat-rate cards typically pay 1.5% to 2% on everything.\n\nBonus category cards pay higher rates (as much as 5% or 6%) at specific types of merchants, such as grocery stores or restaurants, and a lower rate (usually 1%) everywhere else.\n\nBonus categories themselves come in different flavors. On a lot of cards, the bonus categories never change. For example, you might always earn 3% at restaurants or 5% at gas stations. Some cards have rotating categories that change every three months, and you need to &quot;activate&quot; the categories online to qualify for the higher rate. And some cards have customizable bonus categories — you can choose which purchases earn higher rewards, or the card automatically adjusts to give you higher rewards in the category where you spend the most money.\n\nIt's common (though by no means universal) for bonus category cards to cap the amount of spending that qualifies for their highest rates; once you hit the cap, any spending in those categories reverts to the card's lower &quot;everywhere else&quot; rate. In general, cash back cards don't limit the total amount of cash back you can earn, although there are some exceptions.\n\nWhat's the highest-paying cash-back card?\n\nEveryone's spending patterns are different, so the card that earns you the most cash back depends on your individual situation. If you spend far more money eating out than at home, for example, a card that pays 3% at restaurants would likely be a better fit than one that pays 6% at supermarkets.\n\nIs cash back from a credit card taxable?\n\nLegally speaking, credit card rewards are treated as discounts on purchases rather than as income. That means you don't owe any taxes on your cash back.\n\nDoes cash back expire?\n\nCash back rewards typically do not expire as long as your account remains open and active. (Exceptions may apply, so check your card agreement.) Some cards may automatically apply your cash back as a credit against purchases on your next statement; others let you save it up and use it when you want.\n\nShould I save up cash back rewards?\n\nFrom a purely financial standpoint, the best way to use cash back is to redeem it as soon as it is received. Cash back doesn't earn interest, so inflation erodes its value as it sits unredeemed. If you want to put the money into savings, redeem it as a direct deposit into a bank account rather than let it build up. If that's not an option, redeem for statement credit and then put an equal amount into savings.\n\nThat said, it's not a catastrophic error to let your rewards balance build toward a goal — a big purchase, a trip, whatever. Just have a goal in mind, and don't let it sit for years on end.\n\nWhy do credit cards give cash back?\n\nCredit card issuers give you cash back because doing so encourages you to use their cards. Credit card issuers make money from three main sources:\n\nFees paid by cardholders, including annual fees, late fees, balance transfer fees and so on.\n\nInterest.\n\nTransaction fees paid by merchants who accept credit cards, often referred to as &quot;interchange.&quot;\n\nMost cash back cards don't charge annual fees. So in most cases, the only way the card issuer is going to make money off a cash back card is if the cardholder uses the card — and uses it enough that the fees and interest collected by the issuer outweigh the rewards it pays out. Cardholders can make the math work in their favor by paying their bill in full and on time each month. When you do that, you don't incur interest on purchases and you never pay late fees.\n\nAbout the author\n\nJae Bratton\n\nJae is a writer for the credit cards team at NerdWallet.

Without replacement cost coverage, you could end up getting less money for older items due to depreciation.\n\nCostco Executive members may receive additional benefits, including:\n\nGlass repair reimbursement, which will pay up to $1,000 to fix broken windows.\n\nHome lockout assistance, which covers up to $100 for locksmith services, twice a year, if you’re locked out of your home.\n\nOptional Costco home insurance coverage\n\nConnect offers several types of optional coverage that you may be able to add to its homeowners policies, depending on where you live.\n\nBackup and overflow: Pays for damage from a sump pump failure or sewer backup.\n\nService line: Pays for damage to utility lines or pipes that connect your home to the street.\n\nScheduled personal property: Adds extra coverage for valuables such as jewelry, musical instruments or fine art. You may need to have a professional do an appraisal to assess each item’s value.\n\nEarthquake: Covers damage to your home and belongings from an earthquake.\n\nPersonal injury: Covers claims against you for issues such as slander, libel and wrongful eviction.\n\nMine subsidence: Pays for damage to a building located over a mine. This includes settling, foundation cracks or the collapse of your house.\n\nWhat’s not covered\n\nConnect homeowners policies don’t cover damage due to:\n\nFlooding.\n\nEarthquakes.\n\nBacked-up sewers or drains.\n\nLack of maintenance.\n\nAs noted above, optional coverage is available for some of these scenarios.\n\nDid you know...\n\nMost homeowners insurance companies, including Connect, will not cover damage to your home from overflowing bodies of water, tidal surge or other types of flooding. If you live in an at-risk area, you may want to consider buying separate flood insurance.\n\n» MORE: How much homeowners insurance do you need?\n\nDiscounts\n\nCostco members get an exclusive discount on Connect home insurance in most states. You may also be able to save on your premium by:\n\nInsuring a newly built home, or buying a home that’s new to you.\n\nAdding protective devices like security alarms, a sprinkler system or a direct-line fire alarm.\n\nBundling multiple Connect policies.\n\nReplacing your roof.\n\nPaying your premium in full rather than installments.\n\n🤓Nerdy Tip\n\nAnother way to lower your premium is to raise your homeowners insurance deductible, the amount that will be subtracted from your payout if you ever file a claim. Just be sure to choose an amount you’d feel comfortable covering out of your own pocket.\n\nConsumer complaints\n\nConnect had more than the expected number of complaints to state regulators relative to its size for home insurance, according to three years’ worth of data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. \n\n» MORE: 6 essential terms to understand in your homeowners policy\n\nWhat Reddit users say about Costco/Connect home insurance\n\nReddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like homeowners insurance, so we sifted through Reddit forums to get a pulse check on how users feel about insurers. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.\n\nComments about Costco/Connect insurance tend to be relatively positive, with people praising the company’s friendly customer service and affordable rates. However, some Redditors found better rates with other companies, highlighting the importance of shopping around. (We recommend getting at least three home insurance quotes.) Reviews of Connect’s claim processing were mixed, with some commenters having a smooth experience and others reporting issues.\n\nQuestions from Reddit: Our experts answer\n\nCan I save money by switching to Costco/Connect?\n\nIt’s worth checking, especially if you’re already a Costco member. Home insurance rates have been increasing recently across the U.S. due to inflation and more frequent natural disasters. When companies have to pay out more in claims, they raise their premiums to compensate. Shopping around every few years is a good way to make sure you’re still getting the best price for the coverage you need. \n\nKeep in mind that every company calculates its homeowners premiums a little differently, so the insurer that’s cheaper for your friends’ or family’s homes may not always be the most affordable one for you.\n\nHow long should it take Costco/Connect to process a homeowners insurance claim?\n\nThe time it takes to settle a home insurance claim may vary, with some taking a few weeks and others taking months. Smaller individual claims tend to be quicker to process, while severe natural disasters can create a backlog of claims that will take insurers a long time to get through. \n\nSome states have laws requiring that your insurer acknowledge receipt of your claim within a certain time period, such as 30 days. But it may take much longer than that to receive your payout.\n\nDigital experience\n\nCostco’s website has relatively little information about its insurance policies, but the Connect website for Costco members offers more details, plus online quotes and claim filing. You can use your online account to make payments, update your personal information and view policy details.\n\nHow to file a claim with Costco/Connect\n\nYou can file a homeowners claim online or by calling Connect at 800-872-5246. For advice, see how to file a home insurance claim.\n\nHow to contact Costco customer service\n\nCostco members can call 888-404-5365 for customer assistance. Alternatively, they can reach out to [email protected].\n\nExecutive members who are locked out of their home can call 866-641-5443.\n\n» MORE: The average cost of homeowners insurance\n\nCostco home insurance: The bottom line\n\nIf you’re already a Costco member, it may be worth getting a quote to see whether you can save money on your home insurance by switching. But you don’t need to be a Costco member to get Connect homeowners insurance — and the discount may not be worth the $60 Costco membership fee if you won’t take advantage of any other Costco member benefits.\n\nCurrent Product\n\nNerdWallet rating \nNerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Ratings are based on weighted averages of scores in several categories, including financial strength, consumer complaints, coverage, discounts and online experience. These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our full ratings methodology for home insurance.\n\nInsurer complaints methodology\n\nNerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.\n\nIn This Review . . .\n\nDIVE EVEN DEEPER IN INSURANCE\n\n7 Best Homeowners Insurance Companies of November 2024\n\nby Sarah Schlichter\n\nChubb, NJM and Country Financial earned the highest ratings in NerdWallet's analysis.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Average Home Insurance Cost in the U.S. for 2024\n\nby Sarah Schlichter\n\nThe average cost of homeowners insurance in the U.S. is about $1,915 a year  for $300,000 worth of dwelling coverage, but rates vary by state.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Cheapest Home Insurance for 2024\n\nby Sarah Schlichter\n\nAmong large insurers, Progressive has the cheapest annual home insurance on average at $1,815, according to NerdWallet's analysis.\n\nRead more\n\nExplore INSURANCE\n\nGet more smart money moves – straight to your inbox\n\nSign up and we’ll send you Nerdy articles about the money topics that matter most to you along with other ways to help you get more from your money.\n\nSign up\n\nCompare Home Insurance Rates\n\nCompare Home Insurance Rates\n\nGet instant quotes from top home insurance companies and compare now.\n\nZIP Code\n\nGet Started"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:41:25.959755"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2367]]

For other options, see our best balance transfer credit cards or explore our list of the best PenFed credit cards.\n\nIn a market where issuers dangle flashy rewards, juicy sign-up bonuses and other eye-catching extras to entice you, the PenFed Promise Visa® Card can seem pretty pedestrian.\n\nBut there's nothing wrong with keeping things simple, and sometimes basic can be better. As a cost-conscious option, the PenFed Promise Visa® Card stands tall among its peers for what it doesn’t have: There's no annual fee to carry the card, no foreign transaction fee and, crucially, no balance transfer fee.\n\nHere's what else you should know about the PenFed Promise Visa® Card.\n\n» MORE: NerdWallet's best balance transfer credit cards\n\n1. Membership is required, but anyone can join\n\nLike most credit unions, PenFed requires that you become a member to apply for and use any of its financial products. But PenFed has relaxed its eligibility requirements. You no longer need to be related to a member, nor do you have to be affiliated with (or make a donation to) any particular organization.\n\nTo become a PenFed credit union member, just fill out the basic information form, open a required minimum $5 savings account, and you’re in.\n\n» MORE: NerdWallet's best credit union credit cards\n\n2. It's a good pick for a balance transfer card\n\nWhen you’re looking to transfer debt from a high-interest credit card, you typically have a choice: You can pick a card that offers the longest available terms (ideally at a 0% intro APR), or you can opt for a card that charges the lowest fees to make a balance transfer. The PenFed Promise Visa® Card offers a twist on these options. There’s no balance transfer fee, but there's also no 0% introductory APR period, either.\n\nAs of this writing, the card's ongoing APR was still lower than the double-digit interest rates charged by many other credit cards, and it landed the card a spot on our list of the best no balance transfer fee credit cards.\n\nBut it pays to do the math. Long term, it could be cheaper to pick another card with a 0% intro offer if what you’ll save on interest payments overall is greater than what you’ll pay upfront for the balance transfer fee.\n\n» MORE: How to choose a balance transfer card\n\n3. There are no ongoing rewards ...\n\nYou won't earn ongoing rewards on everyday purchases with the PenFed Promise Visa® Card. So if you aren't looking to transfer a balance — and assuming you always pay your bills in full and on time — you’d benefit more from a rewards card that can snag you cash back or points.\n\n» MORE: How to choose a rewards credit card\n\n4. ... But there is a sign-up offer\n\nThat's not to say there's no upfront rewards incentive at all. Somewhat oddly, while the PenFed Promise Visa® Card doesn't earn ongoing rewards, it does offer new members a sign-up bonus.\n\nThat may not be the best credit card bonus offer around, but it's relatively attainable.\n\n5. No penalty APR or late fees\n\nSometimes things happen and you miss or skip a payment. If this sounds like you, the PenFed Promise Visa® Card’s forgiving nature could be appealing. There are no late fees and no penalty APRs — although paying late can still affect your credit scores.\n\nAbout the author\n\nRobin Saks Frankel\n\nRobin is a former credit cards writer for NerdWallet.

It's easy to get started and you'll spend less time worrying about money.\n\nBecoming financially independent for the first time is thrilling, but there’s a lot to learn. Many of us (myself included) learn the hard way and always seem to be waiting on payday or juggling credit card bills.\n\nAt some point, you might stop to ask yourself:\n\nWhy am I always running out of money?\n\nI should be saving something, but how?\n\nDo I have to deprive myself?\n\nCreating a budget helps answer those questions and more. Paradoxically, working within the limits of a budget can make it easier to spend on things you enjoy with less anxiety.\n\nStart by checking out our video below to see just what a realistic budget looks like.\n\nWhy you should start budgeting\n\nGood money management comes down to one thing: Spend less than you earn so you can save money for future needs. A budget is simply a plan to ensure you 1) don’t run out of money and 2) have some money left over to save and invest.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how big or small your paycheck is. The earlier you start investing, the more money you’ll have later in life.\n\nYoung investors become millionaires\n\nHere’s a quick example of how powerful compound interest can be and why people who start investing early build so much more wealth.\n\nAt 22, Jay invests $500 at a 7% return. He continues investing $500 every month and by the time he turns 65 years old, his investment earns him nearly $1.3 million.\n\nMolly follows the same investment plan but waits until 30 to start. When Molly turns 65, her investment is only worth $650,000. Those eight measly years that Jay had on Molly helped him end up with twice as much money!\n\nThe key is to give your money time to maximize interest. You don’t have to start big. You just have to start.\n\nBudgeting helps you hit goals\n\nOne day, if not already, you may aspire to buy your own home or invest in a business. When that day comes you’ll want to 1) be confident that you can afford it and 2) have money saved for a down payment.\n\nSaving money takes commitment over a long-period of time. You don’t want to wait until you want to buy something to start saving.\n\nGet the most out of your money\n\nYour twenties are the best time to do the things you want to do when you’re still young and free of major responsibilities. With a spending plan, you’d be surprised at how much you can squeeze out of your income.\n\nTracking your spending helps identify areas for improvement so that you can spend less on things you don’t need and put that money towards something better. Like that sweet trip to Spain you’ve been thinking about.\n\nGet out of debt\n\nGet rid of that looming debt anxiety for good. Budgets make it easier to pay off your debt without putting stress on your paycheck. You can check off that list much sooner by making it a routine to save a little bit every month.\n\nBe ready for unplanned expenses\n\nLife happens. And that means emergency dental appointments, car problems, a leak in your roof – you get the idea. Budgets help make sure you always have extra funds cached for those unexpected incidents.\n\nYou shouldn’t have to waste money on high-interest loans or awkwardly grovel to your parents or friends. No one wants to see that.\n\nHow to start budgeting\n\nThe first step to start budgeting is to make a list of every dollar you earn and every dollar you spend in a month.\n\nFind your monthly income\n\nGather all your income sources into one place. How much are you taking home a month after taxes?\n\nIf you get paid every other week: multiply your paycheck by 2.166.\n\nIf you get paid weekly: multiply your paycheck by 4.333.\n\nIf your income fluctuates: you can average several months of income. Just try to be as conservative as possible.\n\nCategorize your monthly spending\n\nKeep it simple. Start with last month’s total expenses. Gather all your bills and receipts and figure out how much you’re actually spending per month.\n\nYou can do this yourself in a spreadsheet, but budgeting apps make it easier by automatically categorizing your credit and debit card purchases. Most are low-cost and some are free.\n\nBreak down your spending into categories that make sense for you. For example: living expenses, transportation, subscriptions (like Spotify or Netflix), groceries, medical, debt payments, entertainment. This is an eye-opening experience when you see how small frequent expenses add up over time.\n\nSet a saving goal\n\nGetting on the right financial track is a great objective, but it’s important to work towards something concrete. This helps motivate us to be diligent and consistent with our budgeting.\n\nIf you don’t have a goal, make one! A great first goal is creating an emergency fund for unplanned expenses.\n\nSome other possible goals:\n\nShort-term goals: saving for a trip or a new couch.\n\nMedium-term goals: saving for a car, becoming debt-free.\n\nLong-term goals: saving for retirement or paying off your mortgage.\n\nSet your financial framework\n\nStart by weighing your expenses against your net monthly income. How much wiggle room do you have? What are your goals? What spending categories can use improvement?\n\nStart setting ideal budget goals for each category. Be honest with yourself and your lifestyle. If you enjoy going out for dinners or drinks with friends, include that in the budget as well.\n\nYou can use this simple budget worksheet to keep track of spending.\n\nOverwhelmed yet? That’s okay. There are tons of tools designed to make it easy to create and manage your ideal budget. An app like MoneyPatrol, for example, can be a great way to learn your own spending habits. You’ll set a budget each month, along with a spending goal for each category. MoneyPatrol links to your financial accounts to track your expenses. You’ll even get alerts when you go over your limit in a category. Over time, you’ll know enough about your own spending habits to be able to more accurately set a budget.\n\nAdjust your budget\n\nKeep in mind that our spending habits and income change. Make sure to adjust your budget accordingly. Also, make sure that your budget is actually sustainable. If you’re finding it difficult to stay within that framework, then change it. Be realistic with yourself.\n\nBudgeting methods\n\nYou’ll probably wondering ‘what can I use to make budgeting work for me?’ Put down that Excel spreadsheet for Dummies. There are tons of resources for any type of budgeter – whether you want to do it all yourself or leave it to the professionals. Try as many as you want until you find one that sticks. Remember, it’s all about what works best for you.\n\nThe 50/30/20 Budgeting Method\n\nThe 50/30/20 budgeting method is a helpful place to start for budgeting newbies. Avoid convoluted spending categories. Simply divide your budget three ways: 50% towards living expenses and essentials (i.e. rent, groceries, utilities), 30% towards flexible lifestyle spending (i.e. entertainment, eating out, travel), and 20% towards your financial goals (i.e. savings, debt payments, investments).\n\nRather than giving up your social life, the 50/30/20 Rule gives you a whole 30% of your budget to spend as you please.\n\nGood for:\n\nBudgeting beginners.\n\nPeople who want budgeting flexibility.\n\nKakeibo method\n\nThe Kakeibo method is a century-old budgeting technique from Japan that helps you save more with no technology required. Users answer some financial questions and set savings goals. After that, the next step is to track their expenses, put their purchases in categories, and review expenses at the end of every month.\n\nThis is designed to help you understand why you’re making a purchase that you may not even need.\n\nGood for:\n\nInconsistent budgeters.\n\nFirst-time savers and fearful budgeters.\n\nEnvelope method\n\nThe envelope method is this: store your allotted budget in the form of cash inside dedicated envelopes for each spending category. It’s a pretty old-school method, but a great option for people who want to set stricter limits for themselves.\n\nGood for:\n\nThose who prefer using cash to credit or debit.\n\nPeople who need more financial boundaries.\n\nBullet journals\n\nBullet journaling has become a really popular way of organizing life and staying on top of tasks and goals. It’s now being used as a budgeting tool, too. Bullet journals are hyper-organized and personalized logbooks, which are regularly updated by you. Writing down goals or reminders can hold more weight for people than just typing them out or passively relying on an app.\n\nGood for:\n\nPeople who like to physically write down their tasks.\n\nPeople who want total control of their budgeting.\n\nBudgeting tools\n\nThese are some of the best budgeting apps available to help you get started budgeting.\n\nYou Need a Budget (YNAB)\n\nYNAB is a personal finance management app that syncs with your banking and credit accounts built on the idea that every one of your dollars has a job.\n\n\t\t\t\t34-day free trial\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYNAB\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYou Need a Budget (YNAB) is more than a software program; it’s a lifestyle for budgeting. \n\nWhether your goal is to get out of debt, break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, grow your savings accounts, or all of the above, YNAB’s theory is that giving every dollar “a job” can help.\n\n\tSpecial offer:\n\tStart your journey with a 34-day trial.

Credit cards offer great budgeting resources. They keep track of your expenses on an ongoing basis and organize your spending into different categories. Plus, you can loosen that budget even more by earning rewards on every dollar you spend.\n\nHere are a few of my favorites:\n\n» Best travel rewards card: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card review\n\n» Best card for pretty good credit: Capital One QuicksilverOne Cash Rewards Credit Card review\n\nSingle card tracking\n\nA great option for novices and experts alike is to limit your purchases to just one payment source. It comes with many benefits, but can especially be useful if you get flustered trying to manage all your bills, credit cards, and debit cards. Instead, you just need to keep track of one card. You also reduce the number of bills you need to think about every month.\n\nAs I mentioned, most credit and debit cards have amazing built-in tracking systems that organize your spending into charts.

I know, because I’ve been there.\n\nThe good news is you can get out of debt. And, if you put your mind to it, you can be debt free faster than you think. In this guide, I’ll share the debt repayment strategy that worked for me. I’ll also point out some other debt repayment methods that I didn’t personally use to get out of debt, but that might be helpful to you.\n\nMake a debt repayment strategy\n\nIf you want to get out of debt, the very first thing you need to do is to confront your debt — honestly and without judgement.\n\nIt’s harder than it seems. In my early twenties, my multiple debts were steadily mounting. I knew I was in trouble, but I was too scared to actually tally up how much I owed. I made my minimum payments, then I tried to forget about my debt altogether until the following month.\n\nCreate a debt inventory\n\nTo confront your debt, I want you to make a list of everything you owe. For each of your debts, in whatever format works for you (a note on your phone, a spreadsheet, or with pen and paper), write down:\n\nEverywhere you owe money\n\nYour current balance and credit limit\n\nThe interest rate\n\nYour minimum monthly payment\n\nIt’s a scary exercise; I know. But there’s something powerful about taking even this small step. Do your best not to let this exercise lead to any kind of self-judgement. The circumstances that created this debt don’t matter. This is what’s real today. And that’s all that matters. You are not your debt, and your debt is not you.\n\nYou can overcome these debts. It will take work. And a lot of patience. But you can do this. You’ve already taken the first step.\n\nCalculate your debt-to-income ratio\n\nFor bench-marking purposes, you may also want to take this time to calculate your debt-to-income ratio.\n\nBanks use this statistic as a factor in making lending decisions. A lender will total your monthly debt payments and divide it by your gross (pretax) monthly income.\n\nFor example, if you:\n\nEarn $5,000 per month,\n\nHave a $800 car payment,\n\n$1,000 in student loan payments,\n\nAnd your minimum credit card payments add up to $300,\n\nyour debt-to-income ratio is 42%.\n\nAs a rule of thumb:\n\nOver 40% is the “danger zone”\n\n30% to 40% is higher than desirable\n\n20% to 30% is manageable\n\nLess than 20% is ideal.\n\nPrioritize your debt repayment\n\nNow that you have a list of your debts, it’s time to decide how you will attack them.\n\nThere are two ways to go about this: The debt snowball method and the debt avalanche method.\n\nThe debt snowball method, as popularized by Dave Ramsey, instructs you to first pay as much as you can toward your smallest debt. When that debt is paid off, you take all of those monthly payments and put them toward your next biggest debt. And so on.\n\nThe debt avalanche method, by contrast, tells you to first pay as much as you can toward your debt with the highest interest rate. When that debt is paid off, you take all of those monthly payments and put them toward your debt with the highest interest rate. Etc.\n\nThe debt snowball method is motivating because you can celebrate paying off a debt faster.\n\nThe debt avalanche method will save you the most money because you’re prioritizing debts with the highest interest rates.\n\nI don’t think there’s a right answer here; choose a debt payoff method that feels right to you.\n\nConsolidate or refinance high interest debt\n\nBefore you execute your get out of debt strategy, it’s worth looking at whether your can refinance any of your debt or whether a debt consolidation loan would be helpful.\n\nPersonal loans\n\nA personal loan can help you both save money on interest (if you qualify for a lower rate) and simplify your debt repayment by consolidating multiple credit card balances into one monthly payment.\n\nThat said, it can be hard to qualify for a personal loan if your credit reports aren’t in good shape.\n\nYou can check your credit report for free. Also, it’s easier than ever to see if what kinds of debt consolidation loans you qualify for (with no impact on your credit report).\n\nPersonal loans are best for credit card debt or existing debt balances. Debt consolidation loans may charge origination fees, but interest rates tend to be a bit lower than credit cards. You can use our loan payoff calculator to estimate your monthly payments and how long it will take you to repay a debt consolidation loan.\n\nHome equity loans are another option to consolidate all your debts in one place. To qualify for a home equity loan, you’ll need both good credit and enough equity in your home.\n\nIf you have student loans or an auto loan, refinancing could also be an option.\n\nBalance transfers\n\nIf maxed out credit cards are your problem, a balance transfer card may be able to help you pay off debt faster and save you money with a lower interest rate.\n\nBalance transfer credit cards offer 0% interest for up to 2 years on balances you transfer from other credit card accounts. Most balance transfer cards charge a fee — between 3 and 5 percent of the credit card balance you transfer But, usually, the money you save on interest far exceeds the cost of this fee.\n\nOnly attempt to get a balance transfer card if you have good credit and if you can trust yourself to destroy or not use your existing credit cards after the balances are transferred.\n\n» MORE: How balance transfer credit cards work\n\nRefinancing\n\nDue to rising interest rates, refinancing opportunities are less plentiful today. If, for example, you got a car loan at a very high interest rate (perhaps because you had bad credit at the time), you may be able to refinance your auto loan at a lower rate. The same goes with student loans.\n\nStudent loans\n\nPaying off student loans can be be especially tricky. Federal student loans usually cannot be reduced or forgiven in bankruptcy. And not all loans are eligible to be refinanced.\n\nIf, however, you have private student loans and good credit, there are student loan refinancing options to consider. You may be able to refinance student loans to get a reduced interest rate. But you may also be able to refinance your student loans over a longer period of time. Doing this will reduce your monthly payment but increase the total interest you pay over the life of the loan.\n\n» MORE: Student loan consolidation and refinancing guide\n\nAuto loans\n\nMany people don’t know this, but it’s possible to refinance an auto loan. This can be especially helpful if you took out the car loan when you didn’t have great credit and, consequently, got stuck with an unfavorable interest rate.\n\nKeep in mind, it’s not advisable to extend the length of your auto loan.\n\nIf you do end up trying debt consolidation or refinancing, it’s important that you destroy the credit cards that you pay off with the loan. You don’t want to undo all of your debt payoff progress by racking up new credit card debt with the recently paid-off cards!\n\nSave money for extra payments\n\nHere’s where the journey to get out of debt gets more difficult. To repay debt faster, you need to do two things:\n\nStop taking on new debt (pay cash for everything!)\n\nPut more money toward your monthly bills\n\nFinding the extra cash to to make more then the minimum payment on your debts can be tricky, I know.\n\nThis is where some good, old-fashioned budgeting can be helpful. Yes, it might mean saying “I’ll see you later” to some places you currently enjoy spending money. But the hard truth is that you have a choice to make: Get out of debt, or keep on living your current lifestyle.\n\nA simple budgeting spreadsheet can help you get your finances in order.\n\nAlternately, there are a number of great budgeting apps — some free, some that cost a few dollars a month. If one of them helps you reign in your spending habits and making progress toward your debt repayment; it’s probably worth it.\n\nAlso, use the majority of any windfalls to pay off debt. Getting a tax refund, inheritance, lottery prize, or bonus is a great opportunity to make a big debt in your debt.\n\nI can’t overstate the importance of putting extra funds toward your debt repayment.\n\nFor example, if you have a $15,000 personal loan at a 5% interest rate and minimum monthly payment of $300, it would take you over 4.5 years to pay that balance off. If, however, you increase your payment to $500, you’d pay that loan off in 2.7 years.\n\nEarn more money\n\nGetting out of debt (and doing it on your own), not only requires you to live within your means, but to live below it. Put another way: you need to go from a situation in which you’re spending more than you earn into one where you’re earning more than you spend. And the faster you want to become debt free, the more you have to earn above and beyond what you spend.\n\nPersonally, I knew I was never going to get out of debt just by cutting spending unless, perhaps, I lived with my parents until 35. (No offense, Mom and Dad, but no thanks.) I simply didn’t earn enough money. I had to earn more.\n\nSo, I did several things:\n\nI got a second job (at Starbucks — it was actually some of the most fun I’ve ever had at work)\n\nI looked for higher paying “day jobs” and moved (a couple of times)\n\nI launched websites, including this one\n\nBetween the second job, a career change, and starting websites, I added $15,000 to my annual income fairly quickly. And, in about four years, I went from earning just over $30,000 (in 2005 dollars) to making over six figures.\n\nIt wasn’t an overnight success story. But, here’s the thing: There’s no such thing. Short of winning the lottery, improving your financial standing takes discipline and time. There are no shortcuts!\n\nI do not say this to brag or to claim that I’m anything special. I say it only to make a point. If you put your mind to it, you CAN get out of debt. If you put your mind to it, you CAN increase your income. If you put your mind to it, you CAN get a better job. If you put your mind to it, you CAN start a part-time business.\n\nNot everybody has to earn more money to get out of debt, but it makes it a lot easier.\n\nIdeas to earn more money\n\nThere are literally endless ways to earn extra money, but all could fall into these three categories.\n\nSell stuff.\n\nWork harder.\n\nWork smarter.\n\nSell stuff\n\nIf you have STUFF, then you can make money. Find stuff you don’t use anymore and hit up eBay or Craiglist or a yard sale. The good thing about selling stuff is you can get cash fast. The bad news is it’s not sustainable; sooner or later, you’re going to run out of crap to sell.\n\nWork harder\n\nGet a second job or work overtime, if available. I’ll be blunt, second jobs are no fun. Think of how tired/stressed/soulless you feel after your 9-5 already, now imagine getting in your car, battling rush hour traffic, and putting in another four hours from 9-10. Then you get home around 11, just in time to scroll TikTok for an hour and pass out. Putting in extra hours earns extra dollars, but it can suck the life out of you. If this is the route you want to go, however, there are options: food service, babysitting, mall stores, delivery routes, security guarding, tutoring, teaching prep classes, bartending, cab driving, etc.\n\nWork smarter\n\nThis is my personal favorite way to increase your income, and you’ll see why. Working smarter is about getting promoted at work. Or, if your job won’t promote you: finding a higher-paying job. Or, if you can’t find a higher-paying job: working for yourself. If you make the decision to earn more money by working smarter, you just have to DO.\n\nWhere to find help getting out of debt\n\nPart of taking the steps necessary to get out of debt is admitting when you need help. Although you can save money by getting out of debt on your own, sometimes it just doesn’t work. That’s where the following resources may be helpful.\n\nJust PROCEED CAREFULLY. Although the government has cracked down a bit in recent years, there are a lot of companies out there that advertise these kinds of services that will only make matters worse. AVOID any service advertising “debt settlement” or that promises to reduce the total amount you owe. AVOID any service that charges big upfront fees.\n\nCredit counseling organizations\n\nA credit counseling organization can work with you individually on money management and debt reduction skills.\n\nA legitimate, non-profit credit counseling organization can help you make a plan to get out of debt for a modest monthly fee.\n\nIntroductory counseling can be free but may involve an enrollment fee or a monthly fee afterward depending on the help you need. Most agencies create free debt education materials; however, other services like debt management and repayment plans must be paid for.\n\nWorking with a credit counselor individually won’t have an impact on your credit score. Sometimes, however, credit counselors set up debt repayment plans for you that involve negotiating with your with your creditors so that you can pay less than the minimum payment while you focus on paying off other debts. This can be reflected on your credit report and — possibly — negatively impact your credit score.\n\nVisit The National Foundation for Credit Counseling to learn more or find a credit counseling agency to work with.\n\nDebt relief services\n\nYou may also want to research (either through your counselor or on your own) entering a debt management plan. Debt management plans may be offered by a credit counseling organization. They may also be marketed by companies that do not profit bona fide credit counseling.\n\nUnder such a plan, a third-party company negotiates interest rates, payment amounts, and fees with your creditors. You make one monthly payment to the third-party company and they pay all your creditors.\n\nBe sure to do more research if this is a route you want to go.\n\nDebt settlement\n\nYou may also see ads for debt settlement companies.\n\nThese companies contact your creditors and attempt to negotiate the amount you owe. For example, if you owe $10,000 to Bank A and $5,000 to Bank B, a debt settlement company may be able to get Bank A to agree to settle your debt for $6,000 and Bank B to settle your debt for $2,000.\n\nWhen you work with a debt settlement company, you must pay a significant fee — either a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of the amount by which they reduce your debt.\n\nTwo problems with debt settlement companies are that:\n\nMany creditors will only reduce the amount you owe on a debt if you can pay the reduced amount, in a lump sum, within 30 days.\n\nYour credit report may reflect the fact that you did not repay your original balance in full. This can have a detrimental impact on your credit score.\n\nBankruptcy\n\nBankruptcy has the potential to reduce or wipe out all your debts, but comes with significant downsides.\n\nWhen you declare bankruptcy, a court-appointed trustee will inventory all of your debts and assets. You will be forced to sell any non-protected assets and the proceeds will go toward reducing your debts.\n\nYou get to keep exempted assets that include one car, your primary residence and its appliances and furnishings, and any tools you need for work. Retirement savings such as your 401(k) may also be exempt.\n\nA bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for up to 7 years, during which time it will be difficult to obtain new credit.\n\nYou must pay an attorney and court fees to declare bankruptcy. Depending on your financial situation, you may also be responsible for making reduced monthly debt payments, according to your means, for 5 years. Finally, in most cases student debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\nSummary: How to get out of debt\n\nLiving with too much debt is stressful, but becoming debt free is an incredibly worthy goal.\n\nSometimes, I feel like I lost my entire 20s to my debt. But, during those years, I also worked incredibly hard to become debt free before my 30th birthday. It’s one of the most satisfying things I’ve ever done.\n\nPaying off debt requires dedication and patience. Whichever debt repayment method you use, it’s critical to keep an eye on your spending habits throughout. I don’t know how many times I would make progress on my debt only to take two steps back by overspending a few months later.\n\nYour money deserves more than a soundbyte.\n\nGet straightforward advice on managing money well.\n\nMost financial content is either an echo chamber for the &quot;Already Rich&quot; or a torrent of dubious advice designed only to profit its creators.

Compare co-signers, starter credit cards, credit-builder loans, and other options to see which is best for you.\n\nHow do you get a mortgage, car loan, or apartment lease? By presenting the bank or landlord with good credit history that demonstrates you’ve been financially responsible in the past.\n\nBut what if you don’t have any credit history, because you’ve never been approved for credit?\n\nIt’s the ultimate catch-22:\n\nNo credit card? No credit history.\n\nNo credit history? No credit card.\n\nIf you’re panicking because you don’t know how you’ll get that loan you need without credit history, relax. It can be done.\n\nWe’ll walk you through how to good build good credit fast — even if you’re starting from scratch.\n\nGet Help From a Family Member Who Has Good Credit\n\nA willing parent or significant other who uses credit responsibly can help kick-start your credit score by either co-signing a loan or adding you as an authorized user on a credit card account.\n\nTake Out a Loan with a Co-Signer\n\nThe easiest way to build credit for the first time is to open a loan account with a co-signer who already has good credit. A co-signer is simply someone who agrees to be responsible for the loan if you stop paying your bills for any reason.\n\nIn most cases, a bank will approve a loan for somebody with no credit history if there is a creditworthy co-signer on the application. In order for this to work, you need somebody who:\n\nTrusts you enough to put their credit rating on the line for your loan.\n\nHas good credit themselves.\n\nBe warned: if someone co-signs a loan for you and you don’t make timely payments, your co-signer’s credit will suffer along with your own. If you default on the loan — meaning you stop paying altogether — your co-signer is legally responsible to repay the debt. This situation has ruined plenty of relationships. Proceed carefully.\n\nAnother downside to this method is that it requires taking out a loan. That’s fine if you need a loan, anyway — for example, you’re buying a car. But you don’t have to pay interest to build credit.\n\nBecome an Authorized User on Someone Else’s Account\n\nWith this option, you won’t apply for the card together, but you can ask somebody to add you to their credit card account as an authorized user. Make sure you’re being added to the account as a fully authorized user, as some companies will issue extra cards in different names but only tie the account to one owner.\n\nOne way to check this: do they ask for your Social Security number? If not, this trick won’t help you build credit.\n\nAfter you become an authorized user on a parent’s or somebody else’s credit card, you don’t even have to use the card — as long as they keep paying their bills on time, you will start to build credit. (But it goes both ways, so if they stop paying, this could actually hurt your credit. Again, proceed with caution).\n\nGet a Starter Credit Card\n\nA starter credit card is designed for people new to credit. Unlike many mainstream credit cards, starter credit cards often have:\n\nLower credit limits ($300-$500 is a common start).\n\nAn annual fee.\n\nHigher interest rates.\n\nLimited or no rewards.\n\nSecured Credit Cards\n\nSome starter credit cards are also secured credit cards. What this means is that you need to have money in a bank account equivalent to your credit line. So, if you want to spend $1,000 on your credit card, you need $1,000 in the bank to cover that.\n\nWith secured credit cards, you still make monthly payment — it’s not a debit card, where every purchase is deducted from your balance. Also unlike debit cards, secured credit cards report your payments to the credit bureaus so you can build credit.\n\nStudent Credit Cards\n\nIf you’re a full-time college student, try starting with a student credit card — see our suggestions for the best credit cards for college students. These cards are designed specifically to approve students and you can upgrade them when you graduate.\n\nMany don’t have the lowest APRs or best rewards out there, but you’ll have a good shot of getting approved and can start building better credit.\n\nApply for a Credit-Builder Loan\n\nSome lenders offer credit-builder loans — small personal loans designed for anyone new to credit. They’ll help you build credit, but come at a cost.\n\nIf you take out a small personal loan and repay it in a timely fashion, this will build your credit.\n\nThe Self Credit Builder Account is a fairly unique program that allows you to take out a loan and re-pay yourself. The idea behind Self is straightforward: you open a loan, repay yourself, and show the credit bureaus you are responsible with credit.\n\nCredit Builder Accounts &amp; Certificates of Deposit made/held by Lead Bank, Sunrise Banks, N.A., SouthState Bank, N.A., First Century Bank, N.A., each Member FDIC. Subject to credit approval.\n\nWhat About Student Loans?\n\nIf you took out student loans for college, you’re in luck. While federal student loans are available to anyone, regardless of credit score, they still help you build credit as you pay them off.\n\nOne or two student loans, however, may not be enough to build credit quickly. If you can, you may want to add one or two of these other credit-building techniques to get your credit score higher in a shorter number of years.\n\nBuilding Credit FAQs\n\nWhy Do I Need To Build Credit?\n\nIf you ever hope to get a home loan or auto loan, you’ll need good credit. Many landlords even require good credit to rent an apartment.\n\nIt’s great if you want to stay far away from debt today — but someday you’ll find it’s better to have the credit and not need it than to need it and not have it.\n\nI know a bunch of people who went through most of their 20s without credit. They had no student loans, no credit cards, not even a car loan. They paid in cash and that worked for them. On the one hand, they never had to worry about getting in over their head with debt. But as they got older and started to think about buying a first home (or they just wanted a credit card to take on a business trip), they were years behind others who started building credit in their early 20s — or even younger.\n\nYour credit history may also be used for things like calculating car insurance premiums and employment screening.\n\nI’m not saying this stuff to scare you. Personally, I think it’s crappy that some people get passed over for jobs because they paid a couple of bills late. (And some states are thankfully banning the practice.) But such is the world we live in.\n\nHow Long Does it Take To Build Good Credit?\n\nYou can build an average or good credit score in just a year or two. But it can take up to seven years to build up an excellent credit score of 750 or higher. (Here’s why.)\n\nIt’s possible to build good credit in just a few years, but it requires opening at least a few accounts of each type (loans and credit cards) and being absolutely meticulous about making timely payments. The shorter your credit history, the more a single late payment will set you back.\n\nMost consumers with credit scores in the top 10th percentile (800 or better) have at least 10 years of credit history. That’s because the average age of your credit accounts is one scoring factor. The longer your accounts have been open and in good standing, the more creditworthy you appear to be.\n\nSo even if you don’t need credit today, if you want to get the best rate on a mortgage in 10 years, you should start to build credit now.\n\nHow Can I Build Credit Fast?\n\nYou can build credit quickly by starting with one account, then gradually adding new credit cards or other accounts every six months.\n\nAgain, it will take about two years to build a “decent” credit score. But if you add new accounts — and pay them all on time — your score could be quite good in the same amount of time.\n\nThe first step to building credit is to open an account that reports your payment history to the credit bureaus.\n\nThere are three credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. The bureaus maintain databases of everybody’s credit history and package this information as reports and scores to sell to banks, landlords, employers, etc.\n\nFor the most part, they collect similar information, although each may track this information differently, and there may be discrepancies on your credit history with each. This is why it’s important to check all three of your credit reports at least once a year. You’re legally entitled to a free credit report from each bureau annually, but those reports unfortunately don’t include your score.\n\n» MORE: Here’s how to also get your credit score for free\n\nExamples of accounts that report to credit bureaus include:\n\nMajor credit cards (Amex, Discover, Mastercard, Visa).\n\nInstallment loan accounts (mortgage, auto, or student).\n\nExamples of accounts that do not report to credit bureaus include:\n\nDebit cards (regular checking and prepaid).\n\nUtility and phone bills (electric, water, cable, cellphones).\n\nRent payments, unless you or your landlord subscribe to a rent-reporting service.\n\nSo even if you have a checking account, an apartment, and a cellphone, you may not have a credit history.\n\nWhy Does Having More Credit Help My Credit Score?\n\nSince managing multiple accounts responsibly is more difficult than managing just one or two, the credit scoring system rewards consumers who regularly pay multiple accounts.\n\nCredit scores are funny. I know it seems counterintuitive that someone with more credit cards is less of a risk than someone with just one. But it’s true — to a point.\n\nA good credit score is earned by managing credit well. Until you do that, the credit bureaus don’t have any way to say what kind of credit risk you will be. It’s a lot like safe driving. Insurance companies often give discounts to drivers who haven’t had a ticket or accident in a couple of years. But when you first start driving, you can’t get that discount because there’s no data to indicate whether you’re a safe driver. So showing you can manage a few different credit accounts is a good thing.\n\nThe second reason this will help is for what’s called your debt utilization ratio. This is the percentage of the credit limits on all of your credit cards that you’ve currently borrowed against. For example, if you have two credit cards with $500 limits, you have a total credit limit of $1,000. If you have a $600 balance between the two cards, your utilization ratio is 60% — you’ve used 60% of your total credit limit.\n\nWith utilization ratios, lower is better, and a high ratio will decrease your credit score.\n\nHere are a few ways to improve this number:\n\nOnly use a small percentage of your credit line.\n\nPay your card balances down before the closing of the statement cycle. (This will reduce the month-end balance that is used to calculate this number).\n\nIncrease your available credit.\n\nIf you get a new credit card with a $1,000 limit, now your total available credit is $2,000 and your utilization ratio becomes 30% instead of 60, which is better for your credit score.\n\nDo I Have To Go Into Debt To Build Credit?\n\nNo! And if you can help it, don’t go into debt just to build credit.\n\nIt’s a common myth that in order to build credit you need to carry a balance on a credit card. That’s not true. The credit bureaus reward you for using a credit card and paying it off, whether you pay it in full each month or not.\n\nAnd borrowing too much — especially in the beginning — will likely hurt your credit score, not help it.\n\nUnfortunately, there is some truth to the fact that credit bureaus reward consumers who have both credit card (revolving) accounts and loans with fixed monthly payments. But if you don’t need a loan, you don’t have to take one out and pay interest just to build credit.\n\nCan I Build Credit by Paying My Rent on Time?\n\nIn some cases, yes.\n\nThere are several companies — Rental Kharma, Rent Reporters, and RentTrack, for example — that will report your rent payments to one or more of the credit bureaus.\n\nUnless your landlord or property manager already works with these companies, you’ll need to pay a monthly fee (Rental Kharma charges tenants $8.95 a month). Your landlord will also need to validate your rental payments for the system to work.\n\nAlso know that most utility bills do not count towards your credit — unless you fail to pay them.\n\nWhat Do I Do Once I Get My First Credit Card?\n\nSo you’ve got a credit card. Congrats! Now the only things you should do are: use the card occasionally and pay the bill on time every month.\n\nEnsuring consistent timely payments is the most important part of building credit. Missing your payment just once can set you back a year or two. But as long as you use the credit card and make regular payments, you’ll start to build credit.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, only charge to the card small amounts that you can pay in full at the end of every month. Treating your new credit line like “free money” and then only paying the minimum balance is asking for a big headache when you realize you owe hundreds or thousands at a high interest rate. I know because I made that mistake. Don’t do it!\n\nSummary\n\nIt’s the catch-22 of personal finance: you need good credit to get a credit card, but you can’t build credit unless you’ve got… oh right, a credit card. But there are ways for someone just starting out to build credit. Become an authorized user, apply for a starter credit card, or take out a credit-builder loan.\n\nRegardless of the route you take to good credit, remember that the most important thing is making timely payments, whether on a secured card or a credit-builder loan.\n\nYour money deserves more than a soundbyte.\n\nGet straightforward advice on managing money well.\n\nMost financial content is either an echo chamber for the &quot;Already Rich&quot; or a torrent of dubious advice designed only to profit its creators.

It's easy to get started and you'll spend less time worrying about money.\n\nBecoming financially independent for the first time is thrilling, but there’s a lot to learn. Many of us (myself included) learn the hard way and always seem to be waiting on payday or juggling credit card bills.\n\nAt some point, you might stop to ask yourself:\n\nWhy am I always running out of money?\n\nI should be saving something, but how?\n\nDo I have to deprive myself?\n\nCreating a budget helps answer those questions and more. Paradoxically, working within the limits of a budget can make it easier to spend on things you enjoy with less anxiety.\n\nStart by checking out our video below to see just what a realistic budget looks like.\n\nWhy you should start budgeting\n\nGood money management comes down to one thing: Spend less than you earn so you can save money for future needs. A budget is simply a plan to ensure you 1) don’t run out of money and 2) have some money left over to save and invest.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how big or small your paycheck is. The earlier you start investing, the more money you’ll have later in life.\n\nYoung investors become millionaires\n\nHere’s a quick example of how powerful compound interest can be and why people who start investing early build so much more wealth.\n\nAt 22, Jay invests $500 at a 7% return. He continues investing $500 every month and by the time he turns 65 years old, his investment earns him nearly $1.3 million.\n\nMolly follows the same investment plan but waits until 30 to start. When Molly turns 65, her investment is only worth $650,000. Those eight measly years that Jay had on Molly helped him end up with twice as much money!\n\nThe key is to give your money time to maximize interest. You don’t have to start big. You just have to start.\n\nBudgeting helps you hit goals\n\nOne day, if not already, you may aspire to buy your own home or invest in a business. When that day comes you’ll want to 1) be confident that you can afford it and 2) have money saved for a down payment.\n\nSaving money takes commitment over a long-period of time. You don’t want to wait until you want to buy something to start saving.\n\nGet the most out of your money\n\nYour twenties are the best time to do the things you want to do when you’re still young and free of major responsibilities. With a spending plan, you’d be surprised at how much you can squeeze out of your income.\n\nTracking your spending helps identify areas for improvement so that you can spend less on things you don’t need and put that money towards something better. Like that sweet trip to Spain you’ve been thinking about.\n\nGet out of debt\n\nGet rid of that looming debt anxiety for good. Budgets make it easier to pay off your debt without putting stress on your paycheck. You can check off that list much sooner by making it a routine to save a little bit every month.\n\nBe ready for unplanned expenses\n\nLife happens. And that means emergency dental appointments, car problems, a leak in your roof – you get the idea. Budgets help make sure you always have extra funds cached for those unexpected incidents.\n\nYou shouldn’t have to waste money on high-interest loans or awkwardly grovel to your parents or friends. No one wants to see that.\n\nHow to start budgeting\n\nThe first step to start budgeting is to make a list of every dollar you earn and every dollar you spend in a month.\n\nFind your monthly income\n\nGather all your income sources into one place. How much are you taking home a month after taxes?\n\nIf you get paid every other week: multiply your paycheck by 2.166.\n\nIf you get paid weekly: multiply your paycheck by 4.333.\n\nIf your income fluctuates: you can average several months of income. Just try to be as conservative as possible.\n\nCategorize your monthly spending\n\nKeep it simple. Start with last month’s total expenses. Gather all your bills and receipts and figure out how much you’re actually spending per month.\n\nYou can do this yourself in a spreadsheet, but budgeting apps make it easier by automatically categorizing your credit and debit card purchases. Most are low-cost and some are free.\n\nBreak down your spending into categories that make sense for you. For example: living expenses, transportation, subscriptions (like Spotify or Netflix), groceries, medical, debt payments, entertainment. This is an eye-opening experience when you see how small frequent expenses add up over time.\n\nSet a saving goal\n\nGetting on the right financial track is a great objective, but it’s important to work towards something concrete. This helps motivate us to be diligent and consistent with our budgeting.\n\nIf you don’t have a goal, make one! A great first goal is creating an emergency fund for unplanned expenses.\n\nSome other possible goals:\n\nShort-term goals: saving for a trip or a new couch.\n\nMedium-term goals: saving for a car, becoming debt-free.\n\nLong-term goals: saving for retirement or paying off your mortgage.\n\nSet your financial framework\n\nStart by weighing your expenses against your net monthly income. How much wiggle room do you have? What are your goals? What spending categories can use improvement?\n\nStart setting ideal budget goals for each category. Be honest with yourself and your lifestyle. If you enjoy going out for dinners or drinks with friends, include that in the budget as well.\n\nYou can use this simple budget worksheet to keep track of spending.\n\nOverwhelmed yet? That’s okay. There are tons of tools designed to make it easy to create and manage your ideal budget. An app like MoneyPatrol, for example, can be a great way to learn your own spending habits. You’ll set a budget each month, along with a spending goal for each category. MoneyPatrol links to your financial accounts to track your expenses. You’ll even get alerts when you go over your limit in a category. Over time, you’ll know enough about your own spending habits to be able to more accurately set a budget.\n\nAdjust your budget\n\nKeep in mind that our spending habits and income change. Make sure to adjust your budget accordingly. Also, make sure that your budget is actually sustainable. If you’re finding it difficult to stay within that framework, then change it. Be realistic with yourself.\n\nBudgeting methods\n\nYou’ll probably wondering ‘what can I use to make budgeting work for me?’ Put down that Excel spreadsheet for Dummies. There are tons of resources for any type of budgeter – whether you want to do it all yourself or leave it to the professionals. Try as many as you want until you find one that sticks. Remember, it’s all about what works best for you.\n\nThe 50/30/20 Budgeting Method\n\nThe 50/30/20 budgeting method is a helpful place to start for budgeting newbies. Avoid convoluted spending categories. Simply divide your budget three ways: 50% towards living expenses and essentials (i.e. rent, groceries, utilities), 30% towards flexible lifestyle spending (i.e. entertainment, eating out, travel), and 20% towards your financial goals (i.e. savings, debt payments, investments).\n\nRather than giving up your social life, the 50/30/20 Rule gives you a whole 30% of your budget to spend as you please.\n\nGood for:\n\nBudgeting beginners.\n\nPeople who want budgeting flexibility.\n\nKakeibo method\n\nThe Kakeibo method is a century-old budgeting technique from Japan that helps you save more with no technology required. Users answer some financial questions and set savings goals. After that, the next step is to track their expenses, put their purchases in categories, and review expenses at the end of every month.\n\nThis is designed to help you understand why you’re making a purchase that you may not even need.\n\nGood for:\n\nInconsistent budgeters.\n\nFirst-time savers and fearful budgeters.\n\nEnvelope method\n\nThe envelope method is this: store your allotted budget in the form of cash inside dedicated envelopes for each spending category.

I know, because I’ve been there.\n\nThe good news is you can get out of debt. And, if you put your mind to it, you can be debt free faster than you think. In this guide, I’ll share the debt repayment strategy that worked for me. I’ll also point out some other debt repayment methods that I didn’t personally use to get out of debt, but that might be helpful to you.\n\nMake a debt repayment strategy\n\nIf you want to get out of debt, the very first thing you need to do is to confront your debt — honestly and without judgement.\n\nIt’s harder than it seems. In my early twenties, my multiple debts were steadily mounting. I knew I was in trouble, but I was too scared to actually tally up how much I owed. I made my minimum payments, then I tried to forget about my debt altogether until the following month.\n\nCreate a debt inventory\n\nTo confront your debt, I want you to make a list of everything you owe. For each of your debts, in whatever format works for you (a note on your phone, a spreadsheet, or with pen and paper), write down:\n\nEverywhere you owe money\n\nYour current balance and credit limit\n\nThe interest rate\n\nYour minimum monthly payment\n\nIt’s a scary exercise; I know. But there’s something powerful about taking even this small step. Do your best not to let this exercise lead to any kind of self-judgement. The circumstances that created this debt don’t matter. This is what’s real today. And that’s all that matters. You are not your debt, and your debt is not you.\n\nYou can overcome these debts. It will take work. And a lot of patience. But you can do this. You’ve already taken the first step.\n\nCalculate your debt-to-income ratio\n\nFor bench-marking purposes, you may also want to take this time to calculate your debt-to-income ratio.\n\nBanks use this statistic as a factor in making lending decisions. A lender will total your monthly debt payments and divide it by your gross (pretax) monthly income.\n\nFor example, if you:\n\nEarn $5,000 per month,\n\nHave a $800 car payment,\n\n$1,000 in student loan payments,\n\nAnd your minimum credit card payments add up to $300,\n\nyour debt-to-income ratio is 42%.\n\nAs a rule of thumb:\n\nOver 40% is the “danger zone”\n\n30% to 40% is higher than desirable\n\n20% to 30% is manageable\n\nLess than 20% is ideal.\n\nPrioritize your debt repayment\n\nNow that you have a list of your debts, it’s time to decide how you will attack them.\n\nThere are two ways to go about this: The debt snowball method and the debt avalanche method.\n\nThe debt snowball method, as popularized by Dave Ramsey, instructs you to first pay as much as you can toward your smallest debt. When that debt is paid off, you take all of those monthly payments and put them toward your next biggest debt. And so on.\n\nThe debt avalanche method, by contrast, tells you to first pay as much as you can toward your debt with the highest interest rate. When that debt is paid off, you take all of those monthly payments and put them toward your debt with the highest interest rate. Etc.\n\nThe debt snowball method is motivating because you can celebrate paying off a debt faster.\n\nThe debt avalanche method will save you the most money because you’re prioritizing debts with the highest interest rates.\n\nI don’t think there’s a right answer here; choose a debt payoff method that feels right to you.\n\nConsolidate or refinance high interest debt\n\nBefore you execute your get out of debt strategy, it’s worth looking at whether your can refinance any of your debt or whether a debt consolidation loan would be helpful.\n\nPersonal loans\n\nA personal loan can help you both save money on interest (if you qualify for a lower rate) and simplify your debt repayment by consolidating multiple credit card balances into one monthly payment.\n\nThat said, it can be hard to qualify for a personal loan if your credit reports aren’t in good shape.\n\nYou can check your credit report for free. Also, it’s easier than ever to see if what kinds of debt consolidation loans you qualify for (with no impact on your credit report).\n\nPersonal loans are best for credit card debt or existing debt balances. Debt consolidation loans may charge origination fees, but interest rates tend to be a bit lower than credit cards. You can use our loan payoff calculator to estimate your monthly payments and how long it will take you to repay a debt consolidation loan.\n\nHome equity loans are another option to consolidate all your debts in one place. To qualify for a home equity loan, you’ll need both good credit and enough equity in your home.\n\nIf you have student loans or an auto loan, refinancing could also be an option.\n\nBalance transfers\n\nIf maxed out credit cards are your problem, a balance transfer card may be able to help you pay off debt faster and save you money with a lower interest rate.\n\nBalance transfer credit cards offer 0% interest for up to 2 years on balances you transfer from other credit card accounts. Most balance transfer cards charge a fee — between 3 and 5 percent of the credit card balance you transfer But, usually, the money you save on interest far exceeds the cost of this fee.\n\nOnly attempt to get a balance transfer card if you have good credit and if you can trust yourself to destroy or not use your existing credit cards after the balances are transferred.\n\n» MORE: How balance transfer credit cards work\n\nRefinancing\n\nDue to rising interest rates, refinancing opportunities are less plentiful today. If, for example, you got a car loan at a very high interest rate (perhaps because you had bad credit at the time), you may be able to refinance your auto loan at a lower rate. The same goes with student loans.\n\nStudent loans\n\nPaying off student loans can be be especially tricky. Federal student loans usually cannot be reduced or forgiven in bankruptcy. And not all loans are eligible to be refinanced.\n\nIf, however, you have private student loans and good credit, there are student loan refinancing options to consider. You may be able to refinance student loans to get a reduced interest rate. But you may also be able to refinance your student loans over a longer period of time. Doing this will reduce your monthly payment but increase the total interest you pay over the life of the loan.\n\n» MORE: Student loan consolidation and refinancing guide\n\nAuto loans\n\nMany people don’t know this, but it’s possible to refinance an auto loan. This can be especially helpful if you took out the car loan when you didn’t have great credit and, consequently, got stuck with an unfavorable interest rate.\n\nKeep in mind, it’s not advisable to extend the length of your auto loan.\n\nIf you do end up trying debt consolidation or refinancing, it’s important that you destroy the credit cards that you pay off with the loan. You don’t want to undo all of your debt payoff progress by racking up new credit card debt with the recently paid-off cards!\n\nSave money for extra payments\n\nHere’s where the journey to get out of debt gets more difficult. To repay debt faster, you need to do two things:\n\nStop taking on new debt (pay cash for everything!)\n\nPut more money toward your monthly bills\n\nFinding the extra cash to to make more then the minimum payment on your debts can be tricky, I know.\n\nThis is where some good, old-fashioned budgeting can be helpful. Yes, it might mean saying “I’ll see you later” to some places you currently enjoy spending money. But the hard truth is that you have a choice to make: Get out of debt, or keep on living your current lifestyle.\n\nA simple budgeting spreadsheet can help you get your finances in order.\n\nAlternately, there are a number of great budgeting apps — some free, some that cost a few dollars a month. If one of them helps you reign in your spending habits and making progress toward your debt repayment; it’s probably worth it.\n\nAlso, use the majority of any windfalls to pay off debt. Getting a tax refund, inheritance, lottery prize, or bonus is a great opportunity to make a big debt in your debt.\n\nI can’t overstate the importance of putting extra funds toward your debt repayment.\n\nFor example, if you have a $15,000 personal loan at a 5% interest rate and minimum monthly payment of $300, it would take you over 4.5 years to pay that balance off. If, however, you increase your payment to $500, you’d pay that loan off in 2.7 years.\n\nEarn more money\n\nGetting out of debt (and doing it on your own), not only requires you to live within your means, but to live below it. Put another way: you need to go from a situation in which you’re spending more than you earn into one where you’re earning more than you spend. And the faster you want to become debt free, the more you have to earn above and beyond what you spend.\n\nPersonally, I knew I was never going to get out of debt just by cutting spending unless, perhaps, I lived with my parents until 35. (No offense, Mom and Dad, but no thanks.) I simply didn’t earn enough money. I had to earn more.\n\nSo, I did several things:\n\nI got a second job (at Starbucks — it was actually some of the most fun I’ve ever had at work)\n\nI looked for higher paying “day jobs” and moved (a couple of times)\n\nI launched websites, including this one\n\nBetween the second job, a career change, and starting websites, I added $15,000 to my annual income fairly quickly. And, in about four years, I went from earning just over $30,000 (in 2005 dollars) to making over six figures.\n\nIt wasn’t an overnight success story. But, here’s the thing: There’s no such thing. Short of winning the lottery, improving your financial standing takes discipline and time. There are no shortcuts!\n\nI do not say this to brag or to claim that I’m anything special. I say it only to make a point. If you put your mind to it, you CAN get out of debt. If you put your mind to it, you CAN increase your income. If you put your mind to it, you CAN get a better job. If you put your mind to it, you CAN start a part-time business.\n\nNot everybody has to earn more money to get out of debt, but it makes it a lot easier.\n\nIdeas to earn more money\n\nThere are literally endless ways to earn extra money, but all could fall into these three categories.\n\nSell stuff.\n\nWork harder.\n\nWork smarter.\n\nSell stuff\n\nIf you have STUFF, then you can make money. Find stuff you don’t use anymore and hit up eBay or Craiglist or a yard sale. The good thing about selling stuff is you can get cash fast. The bad news is it’s not sustainable; sooner or later, you’re going to run out of crap to sell.\n\nWork harder\n\nGet a second job or work overtime, if available. I’ll be blunt, second jobs are no fun. Think of how tired/stressed/soulless you feel after your 9-5 already, now imagine getting in your car, battling rush hour traffic, and putting in another four hours from 9-10. Then you get home around 11, just in time to scroll TikTok for an hour and pass out. Putting in extra hours earns extra dollars, but it can suck the life out of you. If this is the route you want to go, however, there are options: food service, babysitting, mall stores, delivery routes, security guarding, tutoring, teaching prep classes, bartending, cab driving, etc.\n\nWork smarter\n\nThis is my personal favorite way to increase your income, and you’ll see why. Working smarter is about getting promoted at work. Or, if your job won’t promote you: finding a higher-paying job. Or, if you can’t find a higher-paying job: working for yourself. If you make the decision to earn more money by working smarter, you just have to DO.\n\nWhere to find help getting out of debt\n\nPart of taking the steps necessary to get out of debt is admitting when you need help. Although you can save money by getting out of debt on your own, sometimes it just doesn’t work. That’s where the following resources may be helpful.\n\nJust PROCEED CAREFULLY. Although the government has cracked down a bit in recent years, there are a lot of companies out there that advertise these kinds of services that will only make matters worse. AVOID any service advertising “debt settlement” or that promises to reduce the total amount you owe. AVOID any service that charges big upfront fees.\n\nCredit counseling organizations\n\nA credit counseling organization can work with you individually on money management and debt reduction skills.\n\nA legitimate, non-profit credit counseling organization can help you make a plan to get out of debt for a modest monthly fee.\n\nIntroductory counseling can be free but may involve an enrollment fee or a monthly fee afterward depending on the help you need. Most agencies create free debt education materials; however, other services like debt management and repayment plans must be paid for.\n\nWorking with a credit counselor individually won’t have an impact on your credit score. Sometimes, however, credit counselors set up debt repayment plans for you that involve negotiating with your with your creditors so that you can pay less than the minimum payment while you focus on paying off other debts. This can be reflected on your credit report and — possibly — negatively impact your credit score.\n\nVisit The National Foundation for Credit Counseling to learn more or find a credit counseling agency to work with.\n\nDebt relief services\n\nYou may also want to research (either through your counselor or on your own) entering a debt management plan. Debt management plans may be offered by a credit counseling organization. They may also be marketed by companies that do not profit bona fide credit counseling.\n\nUnder such a plan, a third-party company negotiates interest rates, payment amounts, and fees with your creditors. You make one monthly payment to the third-party company and they pay all your creditors.\n\nBe sure to do more research if this is a route you want to go.\n\nDebt settlement\n\nYou may also see ads for debt settlement companies.\n\nThese companies contact your creditors and attempt to negotiate the amount you owe. For example, if you owe $10,000 to Bank A and $5,000 to Bank B, a debt settlement company may be able to get Bank A to agree to settle your debt for $6,000 and Bank B to settle your debt for $2,000.\n\nWhen you work with a debt settlement company, you must pay a significant fee — either a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of the amount by which they reduce your debt.\n\nTwo problems with debt settlement companies are that:\n\nMany creditors will only reduce the amount you owe on a debt if you can pay the reduced amount, in a lump sum, within 30 days.\n\nYour credit report may reflect the fact that you did not repay your original balance in full. This can have a detrimental impact on your credit score.\n\nBankruptcy\n\nBankruptcy has the potential to reduce or wipe out all your debts, but comes with significant downsides.\n\nWhen you declare bankruptcy, a court-appointed trustee will inventory all of your debts and assets. You will be forced to sell any non-protected assets and the proceeds will go toward reducing your debts.\n\nYou get to keep exempted assets that include one car, your primary residence and its appliances and furnishings, and any tools you need for work. Retirement savings such as your 401(k) may also be exempt.\n\nA bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for up to 7 years, during which time it will be difficult to obtain new credit.\n\nYou must pay an attorney and court fees to declare bankruptcy. Depending on your financial situation, you may also be responsible for making reduced monthly debt payments, according to your means, for 5 years. Finally, in most cases student debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\nSummary: How to get out of debt\n\nLiving with too much debt is stressful, but becoming debt free is an incredibly worthy goal.\n\nSometimes, I feel like I lost my entire 20s to my debt. But, during those years, I also worked incredibly hard to become debt free before my 30th birthday. It’s one of the most satisfying things I’ve ever done.\n\nPaying off debt requires dedication and patience. Whichever debt repayment method you use, it’s critical to keep an eye on your spending habits throughout. I don’t know how many times I would make progress on my debt only to take two steps back by overspending a few months later.\n\nYour money deserves more than a soundbyte.\n\nGet straightforward advice on managing money well.\n\nMost financial content is either an echo chamber for the &quot;Already Rich&quot; or a torrent of dubious advice designed only to profit its creators.

Yes! Here's why, how to start investing with little money and beginner mistakes to avoid.\n\nEven if you only have a few dollars to spare right now, you can learn how to start investing with that small amount of money. Start investing today with a little money today to have it grow with compound interest and build experience that will be useful when you have more money to invest at some point in the future.\n\nIn this article, we’ll break down the basics of investing and ways you can get started investing — even with just that little money in your pocket. Plus, we cover useful investment strategies and common mistakes you want to avoid as a beginner investor.\n\nWhy is investing so important?\n\nFirst things first. Why should you start investing?\n\nYou’ve probably noticed that inflation is a constant topic of discussion and always in the news. Life becomes more expensive and everything comes to cost more over time, from buying groceries to filling up your car just to get to work.\n\nYou may have also noticed that your income likely doesn’t rise at the same rate. Despite the cost of living going up, you’re probably not earning at a rate to match this increase. There’s ways to ask for a cost-of-living raise but the whole thing probably seems unfair.\n\nThat’s why we can’t stress enough the importance of investing your money now, regardless of what stage of life you’re at. You may think that investing is too risky and, we agree, there’s certainly risk involved — but ultimately it’s even riskier to not have funds invested for the benefit of future you.\n\nHere are the reasons why investing is important:\n\nYou want your money to work for you. The money you worked hard for originally can in return work for you over time and earn a return.\n\nYour money loses value in a bank account. With inflation, your purchasing power drops when you leave your money sitting around, not earning interest.\n\nA traditional savings account just isn’t enough interest. The national average APY on savings accounts is only 0.45% as of May 20, 2024 according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), which doesn’t keep up with inflation.\n\nYou don’t want to work until you’re 70. The sooner you start, the sooner you’ll have compound interest on your side. The whole point of investing is to ensure you don’t have to work forever and have time to enjoy life. That’s why Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) has grown in popularity.\n\nYou’re missing out on “free money” when you don’t invest. Your investments should be earning you money. When you don’t use your money to make money and let it sit around, you’re missing out on what can essentially be free money.\n\nYou should start investing early to build the habit. The point of investing when you don’t have much money today is to learn how to invest so that you’re prepared when your income does go up.\n\nIt’s easier than ever to invest your money. With the rise of so many platforms, there are so many ways to invest money online. You can make an account easily and start investing with just a couple bucks at a time to get familiar with them.\n\nTo put these ideas more into focus (even with just a little bit of money), check out our ‘Latte factor calculator.’ Take just $5 you spend every day and invest it (for real or with our calculator) to see how that can build up over time.\n\nNow that you know why you should be investing and the potential, it’s time to look at the perfect time to start investing. It’s sooner than you think.\n\n» MORE: Best investment accounts for young adults\n\nWhen should you begin investing?\n\nBefore you begin investing you’ll want to make sure the basics of your finances are in order. Investing always involve varying degree of risk, so you’ll be better off if you can be sure you won’t need the money you’re investing for a long time. That’s preferably a horizon of five years or more.\n\nBegin investing after these two financial goals are met:\n\nPay off high-interest debt. You should aggressively try to make payments to reduce your debt. At the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren Buffett commented, “…if I owed any money at 18 percent, the first thing I’d do with any money I had, would be to pay it off. It’s going to be way better than any investment idea I’ve got. And that wasn’t what you wanted to hear.” Paying off high-interest debt if you have it is essentially a guaranteed return and should be a top priority before investing.\n\nStart an emergency fund. Build an emergency fund so that you have three months or more of living expenses in a savings account. You need to ensure you could survive financially if you lost your job or if an unexpected issue, like with your health, that requires immediate funds were to occur you have some cushion without selling your investments.\n\nThe goal is to start investing immediately but only after these priorities are met. As soon as you make progress on your debts and start building your emergency fund, only then should you begin to invest your money.\n\nHow do you start investing with little money?\n\nHere’s a common phrase I hear about investing: “I’m going to start investing when I have real money to invest.” Why is that?\n\nI’ve heard this from many friends and readers who believe they don’t have enough money to start investing or they’re too broke to start and I always disagree. The thought that you have to be rich to invest couldn’t be further from the truth. You should be thinking about investment strategies as soon as you have even a small amount of money. You don’t magically gain investment knowledge once you cross an arbitrary threshold of ‘real money,’ whatever that is.\n\nIt’s understandable that you may be confused about investing when you have competing financial priorities and you’re saving for multiple goals. Heck, you may have debt or you may not have any savings yet.\n\nBut apart from the two recommended steps above (pay off high-interest debt, build an emergency fund), it’s never too soon to start investing. Your first investment can be a $1 that you put to work after learning how to buy a stock or a fractional amount in an ETF. You have to start somewhere and shouldn’t wait.\n\nHere are seven methods to start investing with little money.\n\n1. Try the cookie jar approach\n\nSaving money and investing it are closely connected. In order to invest money, you first have to save some. That will take a lot less time than you think once you get started, and it can be down in small baby steps.\n\nIf you’ve never been a saver, you can start by putting away just $10 per week. That may not seem like a lot, but over the course of a year, it comes to over $500.\n\nYears ago putting $10 into an envelope, shoebox, a small safe, or even the cookie jar made sense. It may sound silly but it was often the first necessary step to get into the habit of living on a little bit less while putting money aside for a purpose.\n\nNow though, there’s options like high-yield savings accounts (HYSA). They allow you to earn competitive interest on your growing cash and when the stash is large enough or you’re ready to invest, you can take it out and move it into some actual investment vehicles. HYSAs also where you can store your emergency fund. Plus, you get to use that cookie jar for cookies again instead of your stomach.\n\n2. Enroll in your 401(k) or similar retirement plan at work\n\nIf you’re on a tight budget, even the simple step of enrolling in your 401(k) or other employer retirement plan may seem beyond your reach. But you can begin investing in an employer-sponsored retirement plan with amounts so small you won’t even notice them.\n\nFor example, plan to invest just 1% of your salary into the employer plan. You probably won’t even miss a contribution that small, but what makes it even easier is that the tax deduction you’ll get for doing so will make the contribution even smaller.\n\nYou can increase it gradually each year if needed. For example, in year two, you can increase your contribution to 2% of your pay. In year three, you can increase your contribution to 3% of your pay, and so on. Start high as you can, though. If you time the increases with your annual pay raise, you’ll notice the increased contribution even less as it splits between retirement and a direct deposit into your linked checking account.\n\nAnd if your employer provides a matching contribution, that will make the arrangement even better. This is something you should try to take advantage of to the fullest.\n\n3. Open an IRA, too\n\nEmployer-sponsored 401(k)s are great, but they don’t offer the same tax benefits as other retirement accounts, which is why opening an IRA is also important.\n\nFor starters, you’ll have more investment options, since you’re opening your own personal IRA rather than going through your employer, where you’re more limited on investment options. Your IRA can hold your favorite individual stocks, like Apple or Microsoft, for example.\n\nIn addition, one of the very best benefits of an IRA (a Roth IRA account, to be specific) is its ability to grow tax free. Your account can both grow without being taxed and you’ll be able to make tax-free and penalty-free withdrawals on accounts open longer than five years starting at age 59 ½.\n\nYou can open an IRA on any of the best investment platforms, but if you’re starting small we recommend you check out Acorns. With Acorns, you can invest automatically every paycheck in your IRA (or other investment account) by setting up recurring investments with their Smart Deposit feature. It’s also a popular spare-change investing app, investing your spare change with every purchase for you. Those features gel well with those who only have a small amount of money to invest.\n\n\t\t\t\tGreat for new investors\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAcorns\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAcorns makes it easy to start investing (even if you know nothing) and provides helpful tools to help you save more automatically. In under 3 minutes, start investing spare change, saving for retirement, earning more, spending smarter, and more. \n\n\tSpecial offer:\n\tClaim a bonus today in three easy steps: open account, set up recurring investments, make your first successful recurring investment (min. $5).

Let a robo-advisor invest for you\n\nRobo-advisors entered the investing scene about a decade ago and make investing as simple and accessible as possible. You don’t need any prior investing experience, as robo-advisors take all the guesswork out of investing.\n\nRobo-advisors work by asking a few simple questions to determine your investing goals and degree of risk tolerance followed by investing your money in a highly-diversified, low-cost portfolio of index funds, mutual funds, and/or bond funds. Robo-advisors then use algorithms to continually rebalance your portfolio and optimize it for taxes, especially on higher balance accounts.\n\nThere’s probably no easier way to get started in long-term investing for a beginner. Most of the best robo-advisors require very little cash to get started and charge modest fees based upon the size of your account. All offer automated investing plans to aid in growing your balance. One of our favorites is Wealthfront, which minimizes trading (great for beginners) and maximizes long-term gains (great for all investors).\n\n\t\t\t\tMost recommended robo-advisor\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWealthfront\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWealthfront is designed for young professionals, anyone from passive investors who want expert digital guidance, to people who want to be smarter with money. \n\nWith low fees and multiple tax perks, automated investment management tuned in to your individual risk level make Wealthfront worth a look.\n\n\tSpecial offer:\n\tOpen your first investing account and get a $50 deposit bonus. Promotional terms apply.\n\n\t\tPros:\n\nPassive investing with automated management\n\nTax-loss harvesting\n\nAbility to customize portfolios\n\n\t\tCons:\n\nNo fractional shares of ETFs in automated accounts\n\nNo human advisors\n\n\t\t\t\tGet $50 bonus\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMoneyUnder30 receives cash compensation from Wealthfront Advisers LLC (“Wealthfront Advisers”) for each new client that applies for a Wealthfront Automated Investing Account through our links. This creates an incentive that results in a material conflict of interest. MoneyUnder30 is not a Wealthfront Advisers client, and this is a paid endorsement. More information is available via our links to Wealthfront Advisers.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nIf there’s any downside to robo-advisors, it’s cost. Robo-advisors charge an annual fee equal to a small percentage of your balance. The industry average is about 0.25%. So, if you invest $10,000, you’ll pay $25 a year. You can avoid paying this by using a brokerage account to build your own portfolio, which is what we dive into next. For the vast majority of beginning investors, however, that’s a lot of additional work, so a robo-advisor fees may seem cheap to avoid the responsibility.\n\n5. Start investing in the stock market with little money\n\nInvesting in the ‘stock market’ doesn’t just mean researching and buying your favorite individual stocks. It can also mean buying index funds or mutual funds.\n\nIndex funds and mutual funds are “baskets” of stocks where your small investment can buy a piece of the whole. Index funds follow an index – such as the S&amp;P 500 – and include the same companies in the same proportions as the index it’s following. They are passively managed, sometimes even managed by a computer, that simply follows the index. Therefore the management fees are typically quite low.\n\nMutual funds are also groups of stocks that you can buy into but they are actively managed and rather than following an index, they follow a set of objectives set forth by the company. For example, the fund may only invest in growth companies. Or perhaps income is the objective so it will only invest in dividend stocks.\n\nOf course, you can also invest in individual stocks. There are increasing numbers of options that have swung open doors to a new generation of investors — letting you get started with as little as $1 without routine commissions to buy or sell.\n\nThe Robinhood app changed the industry forever by bringing commission-free stock trading to the masses. They have been so successful they’ve disrupted the entire investing industry and forced all long-time brokers to follow suit and drop trading commissions.\n\n\t\t\t\tBeginner-friendly\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRobinhood\t\t\t\t\t\n\nRobinhood is a popular stock trading and investing app that offers zero-commission trades on thousands of investments, including stocks, starting with as little as $1.\n\nWith beginner-friendly features and easy-to-read charts, Robinhood is great for new investors and there's advanced features even more seasoned investors can appreciate.\n\n\tSpecial offer:\n\tEarn a 1% bonus with no cap when you transfer your brokerage account to Robinhood before June 28, 2024\n\n\t\tPros:\n\nCommission-free trading\n\nEasy to use, well-displayed dashboard\n\nNo obligation or minimum account balance\n\n\t\tCons:\n\nNo bonds or mutual funds\n\nCrypto fees can be more transparent\n\n\t\t\t\tOpen Account\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdvertiser Disclosure – This advertisement contains information and materials provided by Robinhood Financial LLC and its affiliates (“Robinhood”) and MoneyUnder30, a third party not affiliated with Robinhood.

MoneyUnder30 is not a member of FINRA or SIPC.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nPlus the ability to invest in companies with fractional/partial shares is a complete game-changer with investing, especially you’re starting out with little money.\n\nWith fractional shares, it means you can diversify your portfolio even more while saving money. Instead of investing in a full share, you can buy a fraction of a share. If you want to invest in a stock that trades for a high price, like say Chipotle, you can do so for a few dollars. Basically, instead of buying a burrito, take the cost of a burrito and invest it. You no longer have to match the full price of a share or hope a stock splits to start investing in your favorite companies.\n\n» MORE: Best online brokerage accounts for beginners\n\n6. Dip your toe in the real estate market\n\nBelieve it or not, you no longer need a lot of money (or even good credit) to invest in real estate. A new category of investment known as “real estate crowdfunding” and similar spawn-offs make it possible to own fractional shares of large commercial or other types of properties without the headache of being a landlord.\n\nCrowdfunded real estate investments typically require larger minimum investments. They’re also riskier investments because you may be investing in a single property rather than a diversified portfolio of hundreds of individual investments.\n\nThe upside is owning a piece of a real physical asset that’s not necessarily correlated with the stock market.\n\nAs with robo-advisors, investing in real estate via a crowdfunding platform carries costs that you wouldn’t pay if you bought a building yourself. But here, the advantages are obvious: You share the cost and risk with other investors and you have no responsibility for maintaining the property or even doing the paperwork.\n\nIt’s not recommended to lay all your money on these types platforms or investment opportunities and some are only open to accredited investors, but they do make an intriguing alternative investment.\n\n» MORE: Best real estate investment apps\n\n7. Invest in mutual funds or ETFs\n\nMutual funds are investment securities that allow you to invest in a portfolio of stocks and bonds with a single transaction, making them perfect for new investors.\n\nThe trouble is many mutual fund companies require initial minimum investments of between $500 and $3,000. If you’re a first-time investor with little money to invest, those minimums can be out of reach. But some mutual fund companies will waive the account minimums with automatic investments or require no minimum.\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) hold stocks, bonds, or commodities just like a mutual funds, presenting similar exposure and structure, but they tend to be more liquid since they trade like stocks throughout the day. Plus, ETFs do not require a minimum initial investment and offer more order types.\n\nWhat are the best investment strategies for beginners?\n\nThere are many different investment strategies out there. You could read material from Warren Buffett, Dave Ramsey, and other personal finance experts who will all have different beliefs on investing and managing your money. There’s a wealth of investment tools and resources out there providing a pathway of knowledge for you to digest.\n\nBefore you begin, here are a few things to consider with all investing strategies.\n\n1. Understand your goals and risk tolerance first\n\nWhat are your investment objectives? Here are some goals you may be pursuing:\n\nSaving up for early retirement.\n\nInvesting in real estate so that you can become a landlord.\n\nInvesting in the stock market so you can buy that dream home in 10, 15 years.\n\nAnd so on. The good news is that investing your money is a personal decision, so no goal is the wrong goal.\n\nHere are a few helpful tips to keep in mind if you’re investing as a beginner:\n\nMoney that you need within five years should not be invested in the stock market – whether that is individual stocks, index funds, or mutual funds. There’s plenty of better places to store your short-term savings.\n\nMoney that you’ll need before retirement should not be in a 401(k) or IRA.\n\nWhen saving for retirement, get the employer 401(k) match, then max out your IRA, then go back to max out your 401(k). Anything after that should be in a taxable brokerage account and/or other investments, like real estate or alternatives through accessible platforms like Public.\n\n2. There’s no such thing as a best investment for everyone\n\nI have friends who refuse to even think about cryptocurrency. Then I have other friends who only invest in cryptocurrency. I know people who swear by real estate investing while my investing friends obsessed with dividend stocks are terrified of getting into the real estate investing space.\n\nIt’s important to remember that there are many different investment strategies and there’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution. You may find that investing your money with the a robo-advisor over a broker works best for you, for example.\n\nYour own personal risk tolerance and financial situation will be big factors in your investment decisions.\n\nIf you feel like you need investment advice you can speak to a financial advisor. However, that will likely cost some money – but it might be worth the cost if it gives the confidence to get started. A financial advisor can create a plan with your personal financial situation in mind.\n\nLook for an advisor who is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP). A lot of advisors have minimum investment requirements before they will take you as a client. However, you can hire a “fee only” financial advisor who will charge you a flat fee. These advisors are more likely to work with lower-balance clients as they don’t get paid based on a percentage of your investment portfolio.\n\n3. Different goals require different investments\n\nOne thing you have to accept as a new investor is that you set different investment goals using different investment strategies for every stage of life.\n\nFor example, when you first get out of college, you may want to focus on just starting to invest with a minimum amount as you tackle your student loans and build up an emergency fund.\n\nConventional wisdom is it makes sense to be a more aggressive investor early in life while becoming more conservative in strategy as retirement approaches.\n\n4. Learn to be patient\n\nWarren Buffett is known a number of quotes where he compares the stock market to a money transferring device from the impatient to the patient. And that’s true.\n\nWhat this means is that many beginner investors will lose money because they’re too impatient or because they’re looking to make a quick buck from investing. Investors with the stomach and the patience ultimately benefit.\n\n» MORE: Investment strategies for building your portfolio\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid when investing\n\nWhen some people first get into investing, they just want to get rich quick. I can relate because I read a number of personal finance books and blogs about that very topic when I was a new investor. I wanted to find the secret sauce. But after wasting six months on various get-rich-quick schemes, I accepted that I just needed to focus on investing my money the right way.\n\nThere are plenty of investing mistakes that beginners typically make — mistakes that could cost you thousands of dollars and discourage you from investing in the future (thus costing you much more). We want you to learn from others and avoid these mistakes from the beginning of your investing journey.\n\nHere are common mistakes investing mistakes to avoid:\n\nNot investing early enough. The worst thing that you could do is put off investing because you’re afraid or you only have a small amount of money. You’ll want time to be on your side when it comes to compound interest.\n\nTrying to time the market. There’s an old adage that time in the market is more important than timing the market. It’ll always be right. The market goes up over time — take advantage of that over trying to profit over trends.\n\nGetting involved in shady investments. As tempting as it is to go after those promises of high returns with apparent low risks, research opportunities thoroughly and watch out out who or what you trust your money with.\n\nPutting all your eggs in one basket. It’s crucial that you diversify your portfolio so that you don’t end up relying for one investment to pay off. Don’t rely on exceptions to this and go all-in.\n\nPanicking at the first sight of volatility. You have to understand that ups and downs in the market are normal. When the market drops, it’s important that you keep level so that you don’t end up selling at the bottom.\n\nSelling when an investment drops. You don’t lose money until you sell. Too many rookie investors will start selling off their assets when they begin to see red. You have to be patient and consider short-term fluctuations unless an original investing thesis changes.\n\nTaking advice from random strangers. There’s an abundance of self-proclaimed gurus out there who want to give you unsolicited stock picks. You should avoid these people, courses and ads at all costs. If you do want (solicited) stock picks, consider a reputable subscription service like The Motley Fool Stock Advisor.\n\nNot understanding what you’re investing in. Before proceeding with an investment strategy, you have to know exactly what you’re putting your money into and what it entails.\n\nAt the end of the day, you want to start investing the right way (and as soon as possible) so that your money can begin to work for you now. And, if you make any of these common investing mistakes, then take it as a lesson and start investing the right way from that point forward. No one’s perfect.\n\nSummary\n\nThere are plenty of ways to start investing with little money, including utilizing online and app-based investment accounts that make it easier than ever to invest with just a few bucks without commissions.\n\nAll you have to do is start somewhere, even if you only have only a small amount of money to invest. You’ll start to build experience and down the line your future self will be happy you did without waiting any longer.\n\nYour money deserves more than a soundbyte.\n\nGet straightforward advice on managing money well.\n\nMost financial content is either an echo chamber for the &quot;Already Rich&quot; or a torrent of dubious advice designed only to profit its creators.

I am returning to frugal habits reminiscent of my lifestyle in the first thirteen years after college. This change is prompted by the need to rebuild liquidity.\n\nOne area I'm targeting to cut expenses is food. After a three-month experiment involving increased spending on meals, I grew tired of the excess. Now, I'm swinging the other way—planning to eat less for weight loss, opting for leftovers, and cooking more to save money.\n\nThe first day of the new year marked a positive start toward achieving my 2024 goals. I rose early to edit and publish a post, followed by a 1.5-hour pickleball session—a commitment tied to my New Year's resolutions.\n\nHowever, upon returning home at 11:35 am, my optimism took a hit when I discovered an Uber Eats delivery driver blocking my driveway. Perplexed, I inquired about the address he was searching for, only to realize it was mine.\n\nTo my chagrin, my wife had ordered $48 worth of udon noodles for the kids, while I had mentally prepared to make cost-free grilled cheese sandwiches. Yum! Unbeknownst to me, they had already eaten grilled cheese for breakfast.\n\nCan Be Hard To Get On The Same Financial Page As a Couple\n\nTypically, I'm okay with spending money on food delivery to save time. My wife was being productive, editing the final chapters of my new book. However, with my resolution to save money in the new year, I felt disappointed on the very first day.\n\nHere's the thing: at 12:35 pm, we were heading to a friend's New Year's party, which I attended with our son last year. They host a great party with a ton of food and beverages! So, stuffing ourselves beforehand and spending $48 on lunch felt like a double kick in the nuts.\n\nWe only argued for a minute and then moved on. But it got me thinking about how difficult it can be for couples to get on the same financial page, especially when there is a desired shift in spending habits.\n\nAt the end of the day, I failed to do the following:\n\nClearly communicate that I want to spend less money on food this year.\n\nInform my wife there is plenty of food for both adults and children to eat at the New Year's lunch party.\n\nPrepare food for my kids before leaving to play pickleball for an hour.\n\nHow To Adopt The Same Financial Goals With Your Partner\n\nThe cause of many arguments between couples often stems from unspoken expectations. I had published my 2024 goals post and anticipated we would save money on lunch by attending a friend's lunch party. The problem is, I didn't share my expectations with my wife.\n\nTo me, I just assumed this was a logical conclusion. To her, she did not know what to expect from the party and was busy working. She was also ordering extra to take care of dinner for all of us and continuing a Japanese tradition of eating noodles on New Year's Day for long life.\n\nIn her mind, logically, it was better to feed our children before the lunch party to avoid hangry meltdowns and keep them happy. For reference, our kids usually eat lunch at 11:30 am, so having them wait to eat until 1 pm would be a recipe for potential meltdowns.\n\nGetting on the same financial page with your partner is crucial for a harmonious relationship and can significantly minimize arguments. Here are 10 strategies to achieve financial alignment.\n\n1) Open Communication\n\nFoster open and honest communication about money matters. Establish a safe space for discussions, ensuring both partners feel heard and understood.\n\nRegularly check in on your financial goals and discuss any changes in income, expenses, or priorities. Here’s a new couples wealth tool by Plenty you might consider.\n\n2) Set Shared Goals\n\nDefine short-term and long-term financial goals together. This could include saving for a home, planning for children's education, or preparing for retirement.\n\nEnsure that your goals align with both partners' values and aspirations.\n\n3) Budget Together\n\nCreate a joint budget that reflects your shared financial priorities. Be transparent about your individual spending habits and work together to find a balance.\n\nRegularly review and adjust the budget as circumstances change.\n\n4) Understand Each Other's Money Mindset\n\nRecognize that individuals often have different attitudes and beliefs about money. Understand your partner's money mindset, considering factors like upbringing and past experiences. There's a big difference between having a scarcity mindset and an abundance mindset. \n\nBe patient and empathetic, working towards finding common ground.\n\n5) Designate Financial Roles\n\nClearly define each partner's responsibilities regarding finances. This could involve one person handling bill payments, while the other manages investments, for example.\n\nRegularly discuss and assess whether these roles need adjustments.\n\n6) Emergency Fund and Insurance\n\nPrioritize building an emergency fund worth at least six months of living expenses to create a buffer for unexpected expenses. \n\nSecure appropriate insurance coverage as well. The amount of mental relief my wife and I experienced after getting two matching 20-year term life insurance policies with PoilcyGenius recently was huge. The mental relief alone is worth the cost of the premiums. \n\n7) Financial Dates\n\nSchedule regular “financial dates” to discuss money matters. Make it an enjoyable activity by combining it with a meal or a walk, creating a positive association with financial discussions. \n\n8) Compromise\n\nRecognize that compromise is key. You may not always agree on every financial decision, but finding middle ground ensures that both partners are comfortable with the choices being made.\n\n9) Financial Education\n\nInvest time in financial education together. Attend workshops, read books like Buy This Not That, listen to podcasts that talk about couple's issues, or take courses that enhance your understanding of personal finance.\n\nLearning together will strengthen your financial literacy and provide a shared foundation for decision-making.\n\n10) Seek Professional Guidance\n\nIf needed, consult a financial professional or marriage counselor. A neutral third party can provide guidance, especially during major financial decisions or if there are persistent disagreements. In 2013, I spoke to a financial professional that changed the course of my finances for the better. Due to the consultation, I've made $1 million more dollars eleven years later. \n\nGoing From Spender To Saver Can Be Hard\n\nAfter years of relatively free spending, transitioning from a spender's mindset to a frugal one can be challenging. As the manager of our family's finances, I feel the pressure to ensure our financial security, and the more we have, the safer I feel.\n\nI'm willing to make extreme sacrifices like consuming only ramen noodles and water daily if it means replenishing our bank account. I'm also willing to work 60-80 hours a week for as long as necessary to achieve financial freedom sooner. I know this because it's the approach I took to retire at 34 in 2012!\n\nHowever, I recognize that my perspective might be considered extreme. My fear of poverty stems from growing up in developing countries surrounded by it. Consequently, embracing frugality makes me feel more secure. \n\nFasting all morning to enjoy free food at a friend's lunch party brings me joy. Wearing the same clothes since 2002 feels like a badge of honor. I even wear my socks until they have not one, but two holes in them!\n\nSome might say I have a frugality disease. Despite efforts to be less frugal since leaving my day job in 2012, the reality is that losing a stable income source doesn't make spending money any easier. And neither does having children.\n\nIf I'm not careful, my frugality may lead to lifestyle deflation and unnecessary conflicts with my wife. At the same time, if we spend excessively, financial stress will grow. For the well-being of our family, we must come to a compromise. \n\nBest Strategy To Become More Frugal\n\nIf you feel like you've been spending too much and want to adopt a more frugal lifestyle, one effective approach is to consider the suffering of others.\n\nCertainly, creating a budget, cutting up your credit cards, and avoiding unnecessary purchases are valuable steps. However, the most impactful way to shift from being a spender to a saver is to acknowledge the extent of poverty in the world.\n\nApproximately 828 million people, or 10% of the global population, go to bed hungry every night. When you become aware of this and witness the faces of those who are starving, you are more likely to avoid overeating and gaining unnecessary weight. How can you indulge in another slice of key lime pie when there's a child out there who has only had one bowl of rice and pickles to eat all day?\n\nAround 650 million people live in poverty. Experiencing or witnessing poverty is likely to make you less extravagant and more mindful of your spending habits. Consider watching videos online or taking a trip to a less affluent country. I assure you that such experiences will make you more conscientious about your spending.\n\nRelated: How to spend lots of money and not give a damn\n\nThe Need To Communicate Better\n\nMy wife is not a big spender by any means. She purchased her wedding dress at Target for $80 in 2008, and to this day, her favorite store remains Target, where we go maybe once a quarter. She doesn't own fancy shoes or designer clothes. Most recently, she was perfectly content with us continuing to live in our old house until I convinced her otherwise due to my real estate FOMO. \n\nImproving our communication about financial expectations is essential. I can't assume she knows what I want, and likewise, she can't assume what I want. Continuous assumptions will only lead to ongoing arguments.\n\nTherefore, I'm adding another goal for 2024: to communicate better. Despite writing and podcasting for many years, I realize I'm not the communicator I aspire to be. I need to be more explicit when explaining things to my wife to minimize miscommunication.\n\nAt the end of the day, spending $48 on lunch before a lunch party isn't going to break us. Ordering turned out to be a good move because the food at the party was too spicy for the kids. Here's to better dialogue!\n\nFree Financial Management Tool\n\nRegardless of whether you hire a financial advisor or not, it's important to always stay on top of your finances.

I know that I have enough life insurance that she can replace my income through the rest of her working years so she and our children are not impacted financially should something happen to me. \n\nWe are looking over the budget right now to see if we can make it work for her to stay home – our medical expenses and situation differ drastically from most families. \n\nGiven your wife’s comments about not wanting to return to work, I’m wondering why you feel this is what is best if the same goal can be accomplished by affordable term insurance?  I realize you may not be insurable, if so, this is likely coming across as rather cold – if that’s the case I apologize. \n\nI’m sure this sounds critical, and I don’t know your family situation, from the outside, appears she will be happier at home and you don’t have to deal with a competing working schedule, asking for time off, office policies/frustration, etc. \n\nJeremy\n\n0\n\n    Reply\n\n    Will from Buffalo\n\n    9 months ago\n\nSo here is something the WHOLE family can enjoy to remember how lucky we all are (my kids LOVE this show).\n\nWhen you have family TV time, watch “The Most Dangerous Ways To School” (It used to be on Prime, we catch it on Youtube now….though I hate my kids watching Youtube, I reinstall it and delete it just for this show).

If you’re anxious about money, you may suddenly decide for the family to batten down the hatches on spending. The next year you may feel less anxious, and loosen the reins for the family. If this is truly decided as a family with everyone having an equal say, it’s one thing. If not, it can be quite jarring, and the wildly contradictory and polar opposite habits can be tough to swing back and forth with, especially when you aren’t the one making them.\n\nJust be absolutely certain that it works both ways, and it’s not a one-sided deal where you are in control of all financial decisions, or parenting decisions, or housing decisions, or diet decisions, etc.\n\nI say all of this because I have a tendency to do exactly this.\n\n0\n\n    Reply\n\n    Author\n\n    Financial Samurai\n\n    10 months ago\n\n    Reply to \n    \n        Mike\n\nAbsolutely.

Going from frugal to spending is way easier. ;)\n\n0\n\n    Reply\n\n    Maine\n\n    10 months ago\n\nThis is such a relevant topic for me.  My husband and I have been married for 23 years and have 4 children.  My husband has the frugality disease, which is understandable because his family immigrated to the US with nothing due to the Vietnam War, only after leaving everything behind and then having to live in a Thai refugee camp for 3 years (dirt floor, thatched roof hut, dried fish and rice).  \n\nBecause of the disease, he has a scarcity mindset and emotional attachment to money that is very real and can’t be brushed aside or trivialized.  I grew up in a household where money was never discussed and sometimes my parents could afford things and other times we couldn’t so it was all a big mystery to me.  \n\nFor the first 8 years of marriage, we couldn’t have a “discussion” about money because my husband, who managed all of our finances, would make statements like “We need to cut down our spending and save more” with nothing to back it up.  No numbers on what we actually spent, no action plan, no budgeting, no goals – except for his feeling that were were spending too much.  \n\nFinally, when I started to get involved in our finances, we realized he is the BEST saver and discount shopper and NEVER misses or pays a bill late but terrible in managing the overall numbers, creating long-term goals, or investing.  Luckily, these became my strengths and over the past 15 years together, we’ve grown our net worth significantly and while I’m not retired, he’s been a stay at home dad for over 13 years now and counting.  We are living our “rich” life because we continually worked on our financial goals together, no matter how imperfect the methods were!\n\nPS: I am a long time reader, and while I rarely leave a comment, I do enjoy reading everyone’s comments very much.

Because of frugality disease, I can’t help but want to keep on earning some type of active income though. So I think it’s unique he has frugality disease and is a SAHD.

Because he stayed at home and took care of everything, I was able to focus on my job and grow my career and salary exponentially.  He’ll say it’s because we’re a family and we’re both willing to do what is best for our family, even if it puts us in non-traditional or unexpected roles.  Prior to being a SAHD, he was not handy at all.  But over the years, he’s had the time to become a self-taught handyman and can install electrical outlets, put up drywall, build fences, change the oil in cars, anything, etc.  It’s been a bonus because he can also help out family and friends on small projects that would otherwise cost them a bundle to hire someone that may be unreliable.

(Granted, he has Type 2 diabetes and has to give himself insulin shots before meals, but when you need those calories, you NEED those calories!

I was brought to tears one time when we went out to lunch a bit on the late side, I was very hungry, it took a loooong time to order and receive our meals, and then I couldn’t eat the soup I had ordered because it was way too spicy for me.

We will contribute the max of 61K to our retirement accounts this year and both are on our way to pensions. We have no debt outside of a couple years left on a 2.75% mortgage and a business car payment @ 1.9%. That said, we put everything on one credit card (monthly bills and everything else in order to earn flights/companion passes) and we pay it off monthly. It went from 3K…5K…6K and historically would have spikes of 8-11K during summer travel months with the kids. It now is more like 8-12K monthly with spikes of 18K during summer months and the current remodel. Lifestyle inflation and free spending is a very real thing and very hard to control. Would love to return to the &lt;6K monthly credit card bill range. Have recently moved to a top 5% household income and that probably doesn’t help. Have never got after tax investing off the ground with our projected pensions + after tax accounts + 11-13 year timelines until retirement. \n\nMy wife probably does 90% of the spending, but to be fair, she keeps the home supplied with everything that’s needed. Would love to save up for a home upgrade down payment or keep the exiting home as a rental. I feel like we could easily do so if our free spending wasn’t so high.\n\n0\n\n    Reply\n\n    Author\n\n    Financial Samurai\n\n    10 months ago\n\n    Reply to \n    \n        David\n\n$18,000 a month on your credit card sounds like a lot.

They also offer free and personalized financial calculators to help you make smart financial decisions around taxes, homebuying, banking, and more!\n\nTake Free Quiz Now\n\nEveryone dreams of falling into a lump sum of money, but for most people, it's nothing more than that: a dream.\n\nBut for Ken from Sacramento, California, things are a bit different. He inherited $50 million from his parents and called into the Dave Ramsey Show for advice on what to do with the money.\n\nAfter getting over the initial shock and asking some questions, Ramsey began to provide advice.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf the average American household is a millionaire, why do people feel so broke?\n\nAverage retirement income in America has been revealed – Will you make enough each month?\n\n&quot;The thing that I teach people to do with all of their income is to balance and use ratios between living, enjoying some of it, in other words, giving some of it, and investing some of it,&quot; he said. &quot;And so I would say, how much of this do I want to systematically give.&quot; \n\nHe added the importance of using some of the money to enjoy life, and of course, investing some for the next generation. \n\nReceiving a substantial inheritance, like $50 million, transforms your finances, offering both vast opportunities and significant responsibilities. Managing such a windfall lies in strategic planning and alignment with your values and future aspirations. \n\nInitially, avoid rushed financial decisions. The thrill of inheriting a large sum can tempt you into impulsive spending or investments that jeopardize your financial stability. Give yourself time to understand and adapt to your enhanced financial status.\n\nTrending: \n\nAre you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\n\nFor many first-time buyers, a house is about 3 to 5 times your household annual income – Are you making enough?\n\nCrafting a detailed financial plan is also a must. The plan should cover budgeting, investing, estate planning and tax considerations, customized to your situation. \n\nAnd of course, investing makes sense. Opt for a diversified portfolio to mitigate market risks and inflation, aiming not just for wealth growth but its preservation. Estate planning is equally important, ensuring your assets are protected and passed down as you wish, securing your legacy for future generations.\n\nConsulting a financial adviser can provide peace of mind after receiving an inheritance. Financial advisers offer personalized investing strategies, create effective budgets and work toward long-term financial goals. \n\nRead Next: \n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?\n\nHow to turn a $100,000 investment into $1 Million — and retire a millionaire.\n\n*This information is not financial advice, and personalized guidance from a financial adviser is recommended for making well-informed decisions.\n\nChris Bibey has written about personal finance and investment for the past 15 years in a variety of publications and for a variety of financial companies.

Admittedly, it took us far longer than expected, but we learnt a lot along the way and built our resilience. We overcame many challenges and hit numerous milestones during and after our Testnet – Project Artemis. Notably, we kept our community informed during the entire period and engaged with regular Mainnet and token migration updates. \n\nSignificant Milestones\n\nBlockchain launch – After completing all foundational work and ensuring we can guarantee our user’s safety, on 16 June 2022, we officially launched our mainnet.\n\nCommenting on the launch, CEO Matt Hawkins stated, “The release of the mainnet ushers in a new era for our network and the blockchain and cloud sectors as it sets the underlying architecture for deploying decentralised applications, non-fungible tokens, decentralised financial instruments, and the metaverse on a potentially expansive cloud infrastructure. The support of our community has been immense from the get-go, and we are delighted to achieve this critical milestone in the Cudo journey collectively. Developers and users may now employ Cudos for scalable and affordable decentralised solutions and contribute to the network’s growth and success”.\n\nFoundation launch – Approximately two months after our blockchain went live, we launched The Cudos Foundation to champion blockchain adoption. \n\n“As you may be aware, the Cudos blockchain network rolled out its mainnet in June and is poised to work with its extensive list of partners as well as visionary builders to create ambitious decentralised applications that focus on creating a decentralised, sustainable, and connected world. Within this picture, the Foundation is critical for realising our overarching vision of nurturing high-impact projects that align with our values through the grant program,” said Matt Hawkins, Founder of Cudo Ventures and Board Member of the Foundation.\n\nCudo Compute launch – Less than two months after the Foundation we went live, we launched our fairer distributed cloud platform on 6 October 2022.\n\nCudo Compute – Marketplace\n\nPartnership highlights\n\nThroughout 2022, we continued expanding our network of partnerships and alliances. \n\nThe year began with a deepening of our collaboration and a joint discussion between Cudos’ founder and CEO, Matt Hawkins and Tingo’s President, Chris Cleverly about the potential of blockchain to benefit 10 million people in Nigeria. Similarly, we collaborated with KamPay to support the Coding Africa project developing a learning platform to equip the African youth with coding and tech knowledge.\n\nWe also partnered with AMD and GOATi to create the ultimate gaming experience and with Copernic Space and Sfera Technologies to democratise space data access. Moreover, we expanded the utility of our token by making it available for payments on Shopify and WooCommerce via NOWPayments. Importantly, we remained committed to sustainability with a new carbon-offsetting partnership with KyotoProtocol.io. \n\n“The use of smart contracts has massive potential in the fight against climate change. KyotoProtocol.io allows us to offset our carbon footprint and incentivise it through their DeFi offerings. As building a sustainable computing model is at the core of our company’s values, it is encouraging to know that with KyotoProtocol.io, we can track our carbon credits transparently and reliably. We are happy to partner with KyotoProtocol.io to ascertain that we are meeting our target to stay carbon neutral,” commented Matt Hawkins, CEO and Founder of Cudos.\n\nIt was an important year for Cudo Compute, as well as it partnered with nuco.cloud to reduce wasted computing and with Panchaea and NVIDIA to power the future of the 3D internet. Additionally, the distributed cloud platform joined DPP, the leading media industry association.\n\n“Cudo Compute and the DPP share a mission of bringing customers and suppliers together. In Cudo Compute’s case, we are doing this to create an inherently more efficient and sustainable way of using the world’s available computing resources. Joining the DPP helps us share our insights and thought leadership position with the wider media and entertainment industry in fellowship with the strategic insights and industry initiatives championed by the DPP. Ultimately, we see our membership as an opportunity to not only grow our business but also work with the entire industry in evolving toward an inclusive and fairer cloud ecosystem that is more economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable,” said Gary Negus, Business Development Manager at Cudo Compute.\n\nExchange Listings\n\nThroughout 2022, we significantly expanded the global presence and availability of the CUDOS token. In March, CUDOS went live on Huobi Global in our largest listing to date. Later in August, we expanded our presence across 90+ global markets with a Crypto.com listing. Beyond these centralised exchanges, true to our nature and values, we also went live on Cosmos’ leading decentralised exchange – Osmosis Frontier.\n\nCUDOS logo on Mintscan by Cosmostation Source: https://hub.mintscan.io/ibc-network \n\nAs Cudos’ CEO Matt Hawkins explained: “The recent launch of the Cudos mainnet has been an incredible achievement, the result of years of hard work by our dedicated team and the support of our vibrant and active community. Now that the network is live, we’re looking to the future with our goal of building a decentralised, sustainable and connected world. Thanks to this major new listing on Crypto.com, we’ll be able to introduce a whole new universe of users to the benefits of our blockchain.”\n\nEvents &amp; Awards\n\nWe sponsored, presented at, or attended too many events this year to list individually. Still, some highlights include ETHDenver and the CryptoAM event in February and Paris Blockchain Week in April.\n\nImportantly, beyond merely attending, we made a splash at some of these events. We ranked 8th in Deloitte’s Technology Fast 50 UK and won the AIBC’s summit best cloud computing project award. \n\nCommenting on the award, David Pugh-Jones, CMO of Cudos, said: “Being recognised as the Best Cloud Computing Project at one of the world’s most prestigious blockchain, AI, and crypto events is a huge success and honour for us. While our entire marketing team is thrilled that our efforts in sharing our story with the world resulted in this special award, this is just the tip of the iceberg. This massive success wouldn’t be possible without the tireless work of our tech and product teams developing exceptional Web3 solutions.”\n\nThought leadership\n\nThroughout the year, we continued developing insights and thought leadership across several key themes for our engaged community. \n\nDiversity and Inclusion – We discussed how we’re addressing the crypto gender gap and bringing equality and empowerment through blockchain apprenticeships. \n\n“I have learned many things at Cudos not just as an apprentice but also as a woman trying to excel in a career in a traditionally male-dominated industry. I am pleased to say that I have had a successful start and journey with Cudos so far,” commented Simrun K Singh, Digital Marketing Apprentice at Cudos.  \n\nSustainability – Among the key topics we discussed were the environmental costs of a centralised cloud and NFTs We. We also discussed some of the greenwashing among hyperscale providers and explained the potential of decentralised cloud computing to push back the tide of e-waste. Finally, we detailed our commitment and alignment with the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals. \n\nCloud computing – We introduced a bold new approach to server lifecycle management and outlined hardware capacity recycling as the future of computation. Moreover, we contextualised the cloud industry growth among the broader turmoil and addressed the complicated question of scalability.\n\nGaming – We discussed how blockchain is revolutionising the gaming world and debated whether gaming monopolies would be controlling the metaverse. Additionally, we speculated on the decentralised future of blockchain gaming and discussed emerging GameFi trends.\n\nWeb3 – Setting the context, we discussed Web3’ scalability problem and how Cudos is building the infrastructure needed to solve it. More specifically, we speculated on the future of platforms, privacy and identity, and crowdfunding in Web3. Additionally, we addressed critical questions such as whether Web3 would help or hinder our net-zero ambitions and how it could disrupt the space industry. \n\nMetaverse – Last but not least, we shared our views on the Metaverse and how Cudos is powering its future. We also addressed more universal topics such as the future of digital avatars, accessibility and inclusivity, and the role of Metaverse concerts as drivers of mainstream adoption. \n\nConclusion\n\nIt was a year of challenges, persistence, and, ultimately, successes for us. We appreciate the support of our community and want to extend our gratitude and appreciation and wish you all a happy festive season. \n\nSupport us\n\nCome build with us, visit cudocompute.com or apply for a Foundation grant!\n\nAbout Cudos\n\nCudos is powering the metaverse bringing together DeFi, NFTs and gaming experiences to realise the vision of a decentralised Web3, enabling all users to benefit from the growth of the network.

(&quot;Fortress&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) (TSX:FEI) announces the results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009.\n\nNorth American Natural Gas Market Overview\n\nWith less that 680 rigs operating in the United States and 82 operating in Canada focused on natural gas drilling, the North American natural gas supply may decline quickly absorbing much of the surplus of gas that is currently appearing in buoyant inventories. Mr. Bailey, President and CEO of Fortress, has completed an analysis of North American Natural Gas Markets which can be reviewed at:\n\nhttp://fortressenergy.ca/files/US%20Natural%20Gas%20Markets%20August%201...\n\nalong with \n\n&quot;Has Anyone Done the Math?&quot; \n\nhttp://www.fortressenergy.ca/files/Has%20Anyone%20Done%20the%20Math%20v4.... \n\nHis conclusion is there is an insufficient number of natural gas focused rigs operating, which will cause critical supply shortages and natural gas prices to increase. \n\nRecent Initiatives\n\nIn light of the current down turn and our view of current market fundamentals, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to assist in improving future profitability:\n\n- Entered into a series of forward sale contracts that result in 4.6 Mmcf/d, being 60% of our current production, receiving an average price of $7.92/mcf until December 31, 2009 and $8.36/mcf until March 31, 2010. \n\n- Voluntarily shutting-in approximately 1.8 Mmcf/d of production which can be brought back on stream when higher natural gas prices prevail.\n\n- Reduction of fixed operating costs by consolidating remote operations at Square Creek and re-routing gas at Velma allowing for annual savings of $800,000, being $0.28/mcf. Further operating cost reductions are being pursued. The operating cost reduction will not be experienced in operating results until the third quarter of 2009.\n\n- Entered into a Letter of Intent which allows Fortress to acquire the 50% working interest in Square Creek it currently does not own, for cash consideration of $7,000,000. Completion of the acquisition would provide Fortress an additional 2.7 Mmcf/d of production and the potential to increase production from the area. Since Fortress is the operator of the property, no additional staff or overhead would be required to manage these additional assets.\n\nHighlights of the second quarter include:\n\n- During the quarter Fortress received an average price of $6.22/mcf ($37.35 per boe) from 7.7 Mmcf/d (1,279 boe/d) of production compared to an average spot price of $3.45/mcf during the quarter. \n\n- Operating net back was $1,800,000 or $2.58/mcf ($15.46/boe).\n\n- Achieved funds from operations of $557,000 or $0.02 per share.\n\n- Production from Square Creek averaged gross 5.4 mmcf/d (2.7 mmcf/d net) with approximately 3.6 Mmcf/d (1.8 Mmcf/d net) voluntarily shut-in.\n\n- The low natural gas price environment has resulted in a ceiling test impairment charge of $14,276,000 having the effect of reducing the book value of the Company's assets by such amount. \n\nFortress's board of directors has accepted the resignation of Richard A. Grafton as a director of the Company. In tendering his resignation Mr. Grafton cited personal reasons, and expressed concern that he may not be able to dedicate the time that may be required as a director of Fortress.

See discussion in the following Management Discussion\n\n    &amp; Analysis.\n\n/T/\n\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nAugust 14, 2009\n\nThis management's discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim financial statements of Fortress Energy Inc. (&quot;Fortress&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) as at and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and the audited consolidated financial statements of Fortress Energy Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2008. The interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). All tabular amounts in the following discussion are in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. Additional information is available on the Company's web site at www.fortressenergy.ca or under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com. \n\nThis MD&amp;A provides management's analysis of Fortress' historical financial and operating performance based on information currently available. Actual results will vary from estimates and variances may be significant. Historical results are not indicative of future performance. \n\nNon-GAAP Measurements\n\nThe terms &quot;funds from operations&quot; and &quot;operating netback&quot; used in the MD&amp;A are not recognized measures under GAAP. Management believes that in addition to net income, funds from operations and operating netback are useful supplemental measures as they provide an indication of the results generated by the Company's principal business activities before the consideration of how those activities are financed. Investors are cautioned, however, that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe Company's method of calculating funds from operations may differ from that of other companies, and, accordingly it may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. The Company calculates funds from operations by taking cash flow from operating activities as determined under GAAP before changes in non-cash operating working capital and abandonment expenditures. The consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements present the reconciliation between net income (loss) and funds from operations. A summary of this reconciliation is as follows:\n\n/T/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n($000s)                              Three months ended    Six months ended\n\n                                                June 30,            June 30,\n\n                                         2009      2008      2009      2008\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCash provided by operating activities   1,879     6,883     2,476     8,578\n\nChange in non-cash operating working\n\n capital                               (1,324)   (4,256)     (698)   (4,008)\n\nAbandonment expenditures                    2         -       172        81\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFunds from operations                     557     2,627     1,950     4,651\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperating netback is calculated on a per boe basis taking the sale price and\n\ndeducting royalties, operating expenses and transportation expenses, as\n\nfollows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                           Three months ended June 30,\n\n                                              2009               2008\n\n                                       ($000s)   ($/boe)   ($000s)   ($/boe)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPetroleum and natural gas\n\n sales                                  4,346     37.35     7,231     54.31\n\nRoyalties                                (442)    (3.80)   (1,293)    (9.71)\n\nOperating expenses                     (1,855)   (15.95)   (2,051)   (15.40)\n\nTransportation expenses                  (249)    (2.14)     (237)    (1.78)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperating netback                       1,800     15.46     3,650     27.42\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                             Six months ended June 30,\n\n                                             2009                2008\n\n                                       ($000s)   ($/boe)   ($000s)   ($/boe)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPetroleum and natural gas\n\n sales                                  9,552     41.07    12,868     51.83\n\nRoyalties                                (920)    (3.96)   (2,263)    (9.12)\n\nOperating expenses                     (3,670)   (15.78)   (3,426)   (13.80)\n\nTransportation expenses                  (495)    (2.13)     (449)    (1.80)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperating netback                       4,467     19.20     6,730     27.11\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/T/\n\nBOE Presentation\n\nNatural gas reserves and volumes recorded in thousand cubic feet are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (&quot;boe&quot;) on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (&quot;mcf&quot;) of gas to one barrel (&quot;bbl&quot;) of oil. The term &quot;barrels of oil equivalent&quot; may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalent conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and is not intended to represent a value equivalent at the wellhead.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements in this MD&amp;A may contain forward-looking information including expectations of future production, components of cash flow and earnings, expected future events and/or financial results that are forward-looking in nature and subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company has made materially forward-looking statements:\n\n(i) Under &quot;Capital Expenditures&quot; regarding the Pine Creek exploration well and anticipated timing of production; and\n\n(ii) Under &quot;Liquidity and Capital Resources&quot; regarding working capital requirements.\n\nThe reader is cautioned that assumptions used in the preparation of such information may prove to be incorrect. The Company cautions the reader that actual performance will be affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic and political circumstances throughout the world. Events or circumstances may cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted, a result of numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. These risks include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the oil and gas industry, commodity prices and exchange rate changes; industry related risks could include, but are not limited to, operational risks in exploration, development and production (applicable to the forward-looking statements (i) through (iii) above), delays or changes in plans (applicable to the forward-looking statements identified in (i) through (iii) above); risks associated with the uncertainty of reserve estimates, health and safety risks and the uncertainty of estimates and projections of production, costs and expenses. These external factors beyond the Company's control may affect the marketability of oil and natural gas produced, industry conditions including changes in laws and regulations, changes in income tax regulations, increased competition, fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, and variations in the Canadian/United States dollar exchange rate. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on this forward-looking information.\n\nStatements throughout this MD&amp;A that are not historical facts may be considered &quot;forward-looking statements.&quot; These forward-looking statements sometimes include words to the effect that management believes or expects a stated condition or result. All estimates and statements that describe the Company's objectives, goals or future plans are forward-looking statements. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to any number of risks including, but not limited to:\n\n(i) Risks associated with the oil and gas industry and regulatory bodies (e.g. operational risks in exploration, development and production, or changes in royalty rates);\n\n(ii) Delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures;\n\n(iii) Uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to recoverable reserves, costs and expenses;\n\n(iv) Health, safety and environmental risks;\n\n(v) Commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\n(vi) Liquidity risk and working capital requirements (refer to &quot;Liquidity and Capital Resources&quot; on page 10 of this MD&amp;A).\n\nForward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof subject to the requirements of applicable securities legislation and except as otherwise required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events and results, or otherwise. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\nFortress' primary focus is the exploration and development of natural gas reserves in Western Canada. The Company has approximately 80,500 net acres of undeveloped land in the Ladyfern, Velma and Buick Creek areas in northeast British Columbia and the Chigwell, Bashaw, Square Creek, Halverson, and Mearon areas of Alberta. \n\nThe Company's strategy is to acquire and exploit properties that are early in their development cycle and that offer exploration, appraisal and development drilling opportunities, while maintaining low finding and development costs. Fortress is the operator of most of its production, providing control over cost management of its operating and capital programs.\n\nDETAILED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nProduction\n\n/T/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                     Three months ended    Six months ended\n\n                                                June 30,            June 30,\n\n                                         2009      2008      2009      2008\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSales volume:\n\n Natural gas (mcf/d)                    7,603     8,690     7,634     8,040\n\n Oil and NGL (bbls/d)                      12        15        13        24\n\n Total (boe/d)                          1,279     1,463     1,285     1,364\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/T/\n\nSales volumes for the three months ended June 30, 2009 were 1,279 boe/d compared to 1,463 boe/d for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Total sales volumes have decreased by 13 percent in the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2008. This decrease results from the Company electing to cut back production by 300 boe/d by shutting in several Square Creek wells due to low natural gas prices. This shut-in production can be restored at the Company's choice.\n\nSales volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were 1,285 boe/d compared to 1,364 boe/d for the six months ended June 30, 2008, a decrease of 6 percent. This decrease is consistent with the three months ended June 30, 2009, as previously noted.  \n\nRevenue\n\n/T/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                     Three months ended    Six months ended\n\n                                                June 30,            June 30,\n\n                                         2009      2008      2009      2008\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPetroleum and natural gas sales ($000s) 4,346     7,231     9,552    12,868\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAverage realized prices:\n\n Natural gas ($/mcf)                     3.71     10.32      4.53      9.33\n\n Realized gain (loss) on commodity\n\n  contracts ($/mcf)                      2.51     (1.34)     2.31     (0.80)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Realized natural gas price ($/mcf)      6.22      8.98      6.84      8.53\n\n Oil and NGL ($/bbl)                    45.11    108.04     41.95     88.34\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Combined average realized price\n\n  ($/boe)                               37.35     54.31     41.07     51.83\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBenchmark prices:\n\n AECO average natural gas price ($/mcf)  3.45      9.82      4.18      8.90\n\n Edmonton par crude oil ($/bbl)         66.70    126.37     58.95    112.34\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/T/\n\nPetroleum and natural gas sales which include realized gains and losses on commodity contracts, for the three months ended June 30, 2009 were $4,346,000 compared to $7,231,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2008, a decrease of 40 percent. This decrease is attributable to a 31 percent decrease in the combined average realized commodity price in the second quarter of 2009 from the second quarter of 2008 and a 13 percent decrease in sales volumes. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2009, petroleum and natural gas sales were $9,552,000 compared to $12,868,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2008 - a decrease of 26 percent. This decrease is attributable to a 21 percent decrease in the combined average realized commodity price and a 6 percent decrease in sales volumes in the first half of 2009 when compared to the same period in 2008. \n\nThe average natural gas price realized by the Company for the second quarter of 2009 was $3.71/mcf compared to the AECO average price of $3.45/mcf. This compares to the average natural gas price realized in the second quarter of 2008 of $10.32/mcf and an AECO average price of $9.82/mcf. The average natural gas price realized by the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $4.53/mcf compared to the AECO average price of $4.18/mcf. This compares to the average natural gas price realized in six months ended June 30, 2008 of $9.33/mcf and an AECO average price of $8.90/mcf. The Company receives a slight premium to the AECO price of approximately 4 percent to 5 percent due to the higher heating value of its natural gas.\n\nThe Company uses commodity contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company realized a gain on commodity contracts of $1,733,000, or $2.51/mcf, compared to a realized loss on commodity contracts of $1,072,000, or $1.34/mcf, in the three months ended June 30, 2008, which is included in petroleum and natural gas sales. The Company recorded an unrealized loss on commodity contracts in the three months ended June 30, 2009 of $922,000 compared to an unrealized gain on commodity contracts for the three months ended June 30, 2008 of $151,000. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2009, the Company realized a gain on commodity contracts of $3,192,000, or $2.31/mcf, compared to a realized loss on commodity contracts of $1,185,000 or $0.80/mcf for the six months ended June 30, 2008. In addition, the unrealized gain on commodity contracts in the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $1,496,000 compared to an unrealized loss on commodity contracts of $2,990,000. The Company has sold forward approximately 60 percent of its natural gas production through to the end of the first quarter of 2010 giving the Company a degree of certainty over its cash flow. The estimated mark-to-market value of the Company's commodity contracts at June 30, 2009 was $3,983,000.\n\nAt June 30, 2009 the Company had the following commodity contracts in place: \n\n/T/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                              Period            Volume (GJ/d)         ($/GJ)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSwap         April 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009        5,100           7.20\n\nSwap          January 1, 2010 to March 31, 2010        2,600           8.38\n\nSwap          January 1, 2010 to March 31, 2010        2,500           6.80\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRoyalties\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                     Three months ended    Six months ended\n\n                                                June 30,            June 30,\n\n                                         2009      2008       2009     2008\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRoyalties ($000s)                         442     1,293        920    2,263\n\n$/boe                                    3.80      9.71       3.96     9.12\n\nPercentage of petroleum and natural gas\n\n sales (1)                               16.9%     15.6%      14.5%    16.1%\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Before realized gains and losses on commodity contracts.\n\n/T/\n\nRoyalties decreased to $442,000 for the second quarter of 2009 from $1,293,000 for the second quarter of 2008. This decrease is due to a reduction in the natural gas price which fell from $10.32/mcf in the second quarter of 2008 to $3.71/mcf in the second quarter of 2009 - a decrease of 64 percent. Royalties are not attributed to realized gains and losses on commodity contracts. The effective royalty rate for the second quarter of 2009 was 16.9 percent compared to 15.6 percent for the second quarter of 2008. This increase reflects a charge in the second quarter of 2009 of $60,000 related to an audit and reassessment of Alberta Royalty Tax Credits of a predecessor company. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2009, royalties were $920,000 compared to $2,263,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2008. This decrease is attributed to a 51 percent decrease in the natural gas price realized. \n\nOperating Expenses\n\n/T/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                     Three months ended    Six months ended\n\n                                                June 30,            June 30,\n\n                                         2009      2008      2009      2008\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperating costs ($000s)                 1,855     2,051     3,670     3,426\n\n$/boe                                   15.95     15.40     15.78     13.80\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/T/\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2009, operating expenses were $1,855,000 or $15.95/boe compared to $2,051,000 or $15.40/boe for the three months ended June 30, 2008. Operating expenses decreased in the second quarter of 2009 due to a decrease in production volumes. Operating expenses increased on a per boe basis due to an increase in Square Creek production volumes in the second quarter of 2009 which records higher operating costs relative to the Company's other properties. The Company's Square Creek property is a remote winter-access property which contributes to its relatively high operating costs. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2009, operating expenses were $3,670,000 compared to $3,426,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2008. Operating costs for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were higher than the six months ended June 30, 2008 because they included six months of Square Creek operations compared to only three months in the first six months of 2008. \n\nThe Company has taken several steps to reduce operating costs at Square Creek, including the purchase of a rented compressor, camp, rig mats and other rented equipment. In addition, the Company tendered the field operations contract for Square Creek and re-routed its Velma production to another third party processing plant which is expected to result in approximately $800,000 of annualized savings to the Company.\n\nTransportation Expenses\n\n/T/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                     Three months ended    Six months ended\n\n                                                June 30,            June 30,\n\n                                         2009      2008      2009      2008\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTransportation costs ($000s)              249       237       495       449\n\n$/boe                                    2.14      1.78      2.13      1.80\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/T/\n\nTransportation costs for the three months ended June 30, 2009 were $249,000 compared to $237,000 for the second quarter of 2008. Transportation costs include the transportation and fuel costs associated with the usage of natural gas pipelines. Transportation costs for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were $495,000 compared to $449,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2008. The rate that the Company was charged for interruptible transportation services increased in October 2008. The Company also secured an additional firm transportation services contract at Owl Lake where all of its gas from the general Ladyfern area is sold. \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\n/T/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            Three months ended June 30,       Six months ended June 30,\n\n                   2009           2008            2009            2008\n\n             ($000s) ($/boe) ($000s) ($/boe) ($000s) ($/boe) ($000s) ($/boe)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

A 2012 study published in the journal Family Relations found it’s a stronger predictor of divorce than other disagreements. Yet according to a 2019 SunTrust survey, only 51% of couples discuss finances before marriage. Even more surprising, only 41% of couples disclose their annual salaries, and only 36% bring up debt.\n\nIf you’re in one of these couples, you may be avoiding the discussion out of fear financial difficulties could derail your wedding plans. But merging lives also means merging finances, and if you can’t bring up money with your partner now, it won’t get easier later.\n\nIf you’ve been avoiding having the money talk with your partner, it’s time to open a bottle of wine, light a candle, and sit down for a double date with yourselves and your bank accounts so you can begin your life together on the right track.\n\nMoney Conversations to Have With Your Partner\n\nThe sooner you start having hard conversations with your partner, the better off you’ll be. You don’t need to swap credit scores on the first date. But as David Bach, author of “Smart Couples Finish Rich,” tells CNBC, “You want to know that your life aspirations and your partner’s are going in the same direction.”\n\nAlthough you will and should hang onto some of your own goals and interests, once you’re married, you’ll be creating a life together. You’ll work toward most of your big dreams and long-term goals — kids, houses, retirement — together, and all involve money.\n\nBut there’s no need to start worrying if you discover you think about and handle money in different ways. Bach tells CNBC that your relationship can still work out, but you have to make it a goal to get on the same page financially. And it’s far better to work toward that before tying the knot than to find out after marriage you’re working toward opposing goals or don’t share the same values.\n\nOf course, it’s hard to talk about money. It’s not exactly sexy, and if you’re newly engaged, it’s far more exciting to talk about wedding and honeymoon plans. So if you’re not sure where to start, it’s helpful to begin with a set of prompts.\n\n1. How Do You Deal With Money?\n\nIt’s likely you’ve already figured out a few things about how your partner handles money. For example, do you like to indulge in fancy restaurant meals or keep your dates cheap and simple? Who generally picks up the check? How do you splurge (or not) on each other? Simple observations of each other’s spending habits are good indicators of how each of you thinks about money and how things will continue after you’re married.\n\nBut it is still a worthwhile discussion that can help you uncover more deeply held beliefs about money. For example, what are your shared values about how you both enjoy spending money, and how are they different?\n\nIf you’re in the early stages of a relationship with someone you want to build a future with, now’s the time to have small, bite-size financial conversations you can build on later when things get serious. That way, when the conversation turns from date night to decisions about your wedding, transportation, or housing, you’ve already laid the groundwork.\n\n2. How Did Your Families Handle Money?\n\nFinancial therapist Amanda Clayman tells Chime, everyone has deep-rooted feelings and attitudes toward money as a result of how their families related to it. For example, a 2019 research study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that parents’ attitudes toward debt influence how kids approach borrowing as adults.\n\nThat’s part of what makes money so hard. It’s not that we can’t figure out the ins and outs of how to manage it. We just have so many emotional attachments to our beliefs about it.\n\nFiguring out your respective attachments begins with your “money stories.” How did each of your families handle money? How did they talk about money? Did your parents argue about it? Was money plentiful or scarce? What did you learn from your parents about money that was or wasn’t useful? Discussing these things can help you uncover why you feel the way you do about money.\n\n3. What Are Your Money Fears?\n\nOnce you have each other’s money stories, you can start to understand one another’s money fears and values. For example, if your partner grew up poor or went through a period of financial insecurity, such as a parent’s job loss, they might have a lot of fears about money resulting in a need to hang onto as much as possible to feel a sense of security.\n\n4. What Are Your Money Values?\n\nIt’s vital you understand each other’s money values before you discuss goals and budgets. That goes beyond whether one of you is a spender and one a saver, but rather what you think money’s purpose is. For example, does your partner think money is for security and that’s why they try to stash away every nickel and dime? Or do they think money is for happiness, causing them to spend it more freely on the here and now?\n\nIt’s also crucial to understand that how we spend money may not always line up with our values. For example, I made a lot of financial mistakes early on because I valued the freedom money could provide. Unfortunately, I used nonexistent money to fuel a lot of my choices, and as a result, I created the opposite of freedom by racking up credit card debt. I didn’t see that until later when the debt became too burdensome, and it was too late to do much about it.\n\nHad I invested some of my money or even stashed it in a high-yield savings account and not relied so heavily on credit, I would have created far more freedom for myself instead of a prison of debt.\n\nWhen you start talking with your partner about creating a life of security, happiness, and freedom with your money, don’t discuss only the specifics of budgeting, saving, and investing. Also examine whether you’re actually using your money in alignment with your values.\n\n5. What Kinds of Debts and Resources Are You Bringing Into the Marriage?\n\nIf you and your partner don’t know each other’s money situation, it’s challenging to plan for your future. It’s critical you talk about where you each stand financially.\n\nGo over all your basic details, including:\n\nHow Much Does Each of You Make? Your answers should include your current salaries and any passive income, such as from investments or rental properties.\n\nWhere Does Each of You See Yourselves Going in the Future? What income level are you each trying to achieve? Will reaching it require more education (and thus more student loans)? Will it mean working 80 hours per week for decades? Understanding both your current and future income aspirations helps you plan a life that works for you both.\n\nCan Either of You Take on a Side Gig or Second Job? If you’re saving toward a goal like buying a home or starting a family or looking to pay down debt or pay off your student loans faster, one or both of you may need to take on a night job or side gig if it realistically fits into your schedule. It’s also good to know what’s possible and practical in case a financial emergency comes up.\n\nWhat Do You Each Owe? Bringing debt like credit cards, student loans, and car loans into a marriage is common. According to the 2017 Money, Marriage, and Communication study by Ramsey Solutions, 86% percent of couples who got married in the previous five years started with debt, and 48% of couples who fight about money argue about debt.\n\nWhat Are Your Current Financial Obligations? You each have bills, and if this is a second marriage, one of you may have (or be receiving or about to stop receiving) child support or alimony payments. Is either of you partially or fully responsible for the care of a child or elderly parents? What expenses are involved in their care?\n\nHow Much Does Each of You Have in Savings and Investments? In addition to your salaries, these are the financial resources you bring into the marriage, such as a 401(k) and investment portfolio.\n\nHow Often and How Much Do You Regularly Contribute to Savings, Retirement Accounts, and Investments? To plan for your golden years, you each need to know how much you already have and how much you plan to continue contributing. That way, you can develop a joint game plan to create the kind of retirement you want. You also need to regularly revisit your retirement contributions to ensure you’re on track with your retirement planning at every age.\n\nWhat you’re talking about are each other’s assets and liabilities. You can’t make a budget or plan for future goals, such as buying a house, without knowing these basics.\n\nIf you’re serious about making a life together, you need to figure out how to work as a team to meet your mutual goals while also loving and supporting one another. So leave judgment at the door.\n\nEach of you may come from a very different background and have had different obstacles or opportunities. And that may have affected what you’ve been able to achieve on your own. Fortunately, now that you’re a team, you can play to each other’s strengths.\n\nFor example, my husband, who comes from a working-class background, was never able to finish his bachelor’s degree for financial reasons. It’s limited his earning potential. On the other hand, as the daughter of upper-middle-class parents, I’ve had greater opportunities and have completed a Ph.D. As a result, I’ve almost always earned more money.\n\nBut because I’ve also followed a nontraditional career path, I’ve never had health insurance. My husband has always been the one to provide this benefit for our family. Thus, it’s by coming together as a team that we make it work.\n\n6. What Are Your Credit Scores?\n\nYour credit score may be one of the most important numbers you share when planning for your future. Where you each stand can affect your ability to buy a car, lease an apartment, buy a house, or any number of other situations involving a credit check. If either of you is unaware of your credit score, you can easily check it through Credit Karma.\n\nIf one of you has a low credit score and you plan to buy a house someday, work together to increase that credit score. It may take some time, but when you tackle these situations as a team, you’ll reach your goals more effectively and create a stronger bond as a couple.\n\nWhatever you do, don’t wait until you need a good score to find out your partner doesn’t have one. Credit scores will come to light eventually, so it’s better to tackle the issue before it really matters and potentially cripples your plans. Research by the Federal Reserve Board in 2015 found that the higher your credit score is when your relationship begins, the less likely you are to break up after the first few years.\n\nIf you’re not already in the habit, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on your credit reports at least annually to ensure there are no discrepancies. Your FICO credit score is a compilation of factors that come from what gets reported to the three major credit bureaus — Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. You’re entitled to one free report from each bureau per year, which you can get from AnnualCreditReport.com.\n\nPro Tip: You can sign up for a free Experian Boost account and start improving your credit score almost immediately.\n\n7. How Will You Merge Your Money?\n\nNo matter how financially independent you were before marriage, merging your lives includes merging your money.\n\nIt’s essential you come to think of your money as a shared resource rather than “mine” versus “yours.” Otherwise, you’ll have a difficult time working together to reach mutual goals. Moreover, without some method of sharing money for things like food, bills, child care, and entertainment, one or both of you are likely to feel resentful about spending “their” money on a shared expense.\n\nThat doesn’t mean every couple needs to have a joint checking account and savings account. While 76% percent of couples have a shared bank account, according to a 2016 TD Bank survey, The Atlantic reports that more and more young couples are opting out of joint accounts.\n\nThere isn’t one right option for everyone. The important thing is finding a solution that works best for you. Communication is key. And no matter which option you choose, your resources are for the good of the marriage. Otherwise, you might as well be living separate lives.\n\nIf you have physical property or investment and retirement assets, also discuss if and how you will merge these. For example, whose sofa will you keep? If you both own houses, which will you keep? Will you leave property or accounts in individual names, or will they be held jointly? Deciding these things now helps prevent misunderstandings and conflict down the road.\n\n8. How Can You Each Maintain Some Money Independence?\n\nEven if you decide to merge all your money into one account, it’s crucial to feel like you have some freedom and flexibility over small purchases. It can feel too constraining to have to account to your spouse for every dollar you spend.\n\nDiscuss how you will deal with personal spending. Many couples set a dollar limit on purchases that need to be discussed jointly, such as anything over $100. Other couples opt for a joint account to pay shared expenses and individual accounts for personal spending money. That way, anything you spend out of your personal accounts doesn’t need to be discussed — or become grounds for argument.\n\nFor example, my husband and I have a joint account for all household expenses and separate accounts for personal spending. We decide on a set limit to give each other for our personal accounts, and we allocate the rest of our money for bills and savings.\n\nAdditionally, there may be some assets you decide never to merge, and for those, you may want to have a lawyer draft a prenuptial agreement before the big day.\n\nFor example, if one or both of you came to the marriage with their own business, especially if you co-own it with a partner who isn’t your spouse, a prenuptial agreement is a must for protecting that asset in case of divorce. A prenup can also protect a significant inheritance or property one of you owned before entering the marriage.\n\nPrenups aren’t always about setting aside money, though. Sometimes they can protect a spouse from the other’s debts. If one of you is deep in debt, a prenuptial agreement can protect the other spouse from having marital property seized by creditors.\n\nYou can even use a prenup to outline financial responsibilities. For example, if one of you takes time off their career to raise your children, it could state that they’re owed compensation for that time in the event of your divorce.\n\nNo one wants to think about it, but no marriage is guaranteed to last forever. And it’s far better for your wallet to have two partners who are level-headed and thinking clearly draft an agreement today versus two bitter ex-partners who are willing to spend any amount of money on expensive divorce lawyers just to get revenge duking it out in court later.\n\n9. How Will You Divide Financial Responsibilities?\n\nAs a single person, you’ve been doing everything on your own. But once you merge finances, you have to decide who’ll do what. After all, you can’t both write a check for the same rent due every month. So decide if you’ll split duties or if one person will handle most things with input from the other.\n\nFor example, in my marriage, I’m the one who loves drafting up budgets, comparison-shopping for the best deals, running savings calculators, and geeking out over compound interest rates. My husband prefers to be told what he can spend and when. So I’m the one who manages all our finances.\n\nIf you go this route, ensure you talk with your partner about what you’re doing. It’s easy to fall into the trap of unilaterally making all the decisions yourself since you’re the one who’s physically doing it all. But that’s a quick exit from the team, even if the other spouse isn’t all that interested in money.\n\nPlus, it’s essential you both know where all your money is, how to pay all the crucial bills, and what all the relevant passwords are in case the worst should happen.\n\nI keep my husband in the loop by sitting down with him once or twice per month and going over our budget, savings, and investments. We talk about our big savings goals and whether to adjust the budget. And then he leaves the details of handling the daily bill-paying to me.\n\nThat type of system may work for you too, or both of you may want a hand in money-managing. In that case, come up with a plan for deciding who pays what bills. For example, perhaps you pay the mortgage, and your spouse pays the electric bill. That’s what my parents did their entire marriage.\n\nYou can also divide the bill paying in line with income. My dad paid the mortgage because he earned more, and that was a bigger bill. My mom paid the utilities because her smaller income was more proportionate with those bills.\n\nIf you decide to go this route, you must determine whether you’ll divide the bills equally and whether to pay them from your own separate accounts or one joint account.\n\n10. What Are Your Life Goals?\n\nWhat kind of life do you want to build together? Do you want to buy a house? Have kids? Travel, either now or in the future?\n\nRather than diving headfirst into the discussion, spend some time individually writing down all your goals for one year from now, five years from now, and so on. Then, come together and compare. Talk in depth about your mutual hopes and dreams and find out if you have the same vision for your lives.\n\nIf your goals aren’t all mutual, don’t despair. You simply have to work together on your shared goals and figure out how to support each other in achieving the personal goals important to each of you, such as going back to school.\n\nPerhaps more than any other discussion, it’s vital you have this one before marriage. Marriage is about merging two lives. You’re getting married because you love each other, but if you have very different plans for your lives — for example, one of you really wants kids, but the other is dead set against it — you need to think long and hard about whether merging your lives is the best idea.\n\nThat doesn’t mean all your goals have to align, but at some point, you have to figure out if you’re compatible on the big ones and how to come together on the smaller ones.\n\nFor example, if one of you wants to travel full time but the other is a homebody who’s afraid of airplanes, that could be a deal-breaker for your marriage. Or perhaps you’re willing to compromise. For example, the traveler can go on occasional adventures with a friend.\n\nBut not everything has a compromisable solution. Maybe one of you has always wanted kids, and the other doesn’t want them. Sometimes, people indeed change. I’ve witnessed it myself. But you can’t count on that because often, they don’t.\n\nYou can’t plan for the future with wishful thinking. Whether a partner is dead-set against kids or just ambivalent, they’ll be less willing to financially prepare for a family they’re not sure they want, especially if something they really want comes along instead.\n\n11. How Will You Work Together to Meet Your Goals?\n\nMany of our life goals, such as buying a house, having kids, and taking annual vacations, require money. So, how will you get that money? How much will you save for retirement? For a house? How will you manage the cost of having kids? How much is each of you willing to sacrifice in the short term to make your long-term dreams come true?\n\nFor example, say you’ve always dreamed of owning a home, and you plan to buy one in the next five years. You may be fine making sacrifices, such as taking fewer vacations or purchasing a used car to save up for a down payment, but is your partner? If your partner is the one with the big goals, such as starting their own business, are you OK making sacrifices to help them achieve these goals?\n\nWhatever your goals are, you need to work together to make a plan to achieve them. Without a plan, these goals will remain out of reach.\n\n12. How Will You Budget Your Money?\n\nAfter you’ve worked out an overall plan for reaching your goals, it’s time to sit down and work out a monthly budget, which you can start using right now or after you’re married. Consider your current income, how often you receive paychecks, whether it’s consistent or irregular pay, and what you can reasonably count on making each month. Then, work out your expenses.\n\nSome expense categories, such as your rent and car payment, are fixed, while others, such as your utilities and groceries, may fluctuate from one month to the next. Also, you may have some months with additional expenses, such as car maintenance and repairs or holiday gift giving.\n\nTalk about what you both want your monthly budget to look like, how much you should be spending in each category, and how much you’ll have left to put toward your financial goals. That should include an emergency fund of at least $1,000 if you don’t already have one. Although you may not be married yet, it’s never too soon to start saving.\n\nWorking together, you can create a budget that fits your income and allows you to enjoy spending some of your money while also working toward your goals.\n\nPro Tip: If you and your significant other need help setting your budget, there are several great programs you can use. One of our favorites is Tiller.\n\n13. Whose Insurance Should You Be On?\n\nOnce you’re married, you’ll have the opportunity to enroll in health care coverage outside the annual enrollment period. This “qualifying life event” allows you and your partner the option to join one or the other’s health insurance plan or sign up on the health insurance marketplace.\n\nIf neither of you currently has insurance, you can shop for insurance on the federal or your state marketplace at HealthCare.gov. See our guide to buying health insurance on the marketplace to learn how.\n\nBe aware that if one of you already has a marketplace plan and the other has job-based health insurance that’s deemed affordable and covers spouses and dependents, you can keep your marketplace insurance, but it may get more expensive.\n\nAccording to HealthCare.gov, for the purpose of Affordable Care Act-compliant insurance, “deemed affordable” means a plan covering only the employee must be 9.83% or less of the employee’s household income.\n\nIf that spouse’s insurance is available to spouses and dependents, the other spouse may not qualify for subsidized health insurance at the marketplace if the coverage they’re offering you is deemed affordable.\n\nTo find out if employer-sponsored coverage is deemed affordable and meets the minimum value standards under the law, you can ask the employer to use the Employer Coverage Tool.\n\nIf both of you have job-based insurance, compare each of your plans. Which of you has the medical plan with the best coverage for the least possible expense? Does it make more sense to continue carrying two individual policies or have one spousal policy?\n\nSome insurance carriers differentiate between individual, spousal, and family plans. Others only give you the option of individual or family plans. If you have to opt for a family plan, your premium will be higher than a spousal plan, but it may still be less than carrying two separate plans.\n\nAlso consider your future goals. If you plan to have kids, does either plan cover fertility treatments like IVF if necessary? Does the coverage vary depending on whether it’s for the employee, spouse, or child?\n\nAnd if you end up with a high-deductible plan that qualifies for a health savings account (HSA), weigh the pros and cons of signing up and fully funding it. HSAs are excellent tax-sheltered investment vehicles that let you pay for medical expenses now (perfect if you’re planning to have a family) and continue to roll over yearly. And once you hit your golden years, you can draw on your HSA for nonmedical retirement expenses.\n\nPro Tip: If your employer doesn’t offer an HSA, sign up with Lively. There are no hidden fees, and you can set up recurring contributions.\n\nFor more help, see our guide on choosing the best health insurance plan for your family.\n\n14. How Much Will You Spend on the Wedding?\n\nAccording to The Knot’s annual Real Weddings Study, the average cost of a wedding in 2019 was $28,000. That number dipped to $19,000 in 2020 thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the Knot predicts it will rise back to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.\n\nAnd while the 2018 Brides American Wedding Study found that couples’ parents completely paid for 42% of the weddings, 58% of couples contributed at least in part to the total cost of their nuptials.\n\nMany couples simply can’t afford this kind of wedding without going into debt. Yet the Money, Marriage, and Communication study reported that 41% of couples felt pressured to pay for more wedding than they could afford, and more than half (54%) of those married within the last five years paid for at least some of their wedding expenses with a credit card.\n\nPerhaps more important, 73% of those couples say they regret that decision. Since 86% of couples enter into marriage with debt, planning for your future together means thinking hard about whether it makes sense to take on any more.\n\nIf you feel the pressure to go into debt to impress your guests with a lavish wedding, it’s worth considering whether you’ll still be happy with that choice 10 years down the road when you’re still paying the credit card bill.\n\nAlso, if you use credit to finance your wedding, you could end up paying as much as three times the original cost if you can’t immediately pay off the balance.\n\nAsk each other if you’re comfortable taking on debt for a pricey dream wedding. And know that research has found that cheaper weddings often lead to happier marriages.\n\nEven if you don’t need to take on debt, paying for an expensive wedding still creates an opportunity cost. Is there something more valuable you could spend it on? Putting a down payment on a house? Contributing to an earlier retirement?\n\nGetting married is an exciting time for all couples, but there are plenty of ways to have the wedding of your dreams without breaking the bank. Although it’s been nearly a decade since my husband and I were married, we were able to pull off my dream wedding in a botanical garden for $5,000 by opting for budget options on flowers and my dress and DIYing our wedding invitations, programs, and decorations.\n\nUltimately, it’s up to you to decide how much your special day is worth, but it’s possible to have a beautiful wedding without crippling your financial future. For more information, see our guide to getting married on a budget.\n\n15. Do You Want Kids?\n\nWhether or not you want kids is a major life decision for every couple — and a financial one. According to calculations by the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), it will cost parents an average of $233,610 to raise a child born in 2015 from birth through the age of 17. That’s an average of $1,145 per month per child added to the family budget.\n\nThe costs of child-rearing vary by age, location, and socioeconomic status. For example, the USDA calculates that higher-income families can expect to spend an average of $372,210 on each child. No matter how big the number, note that the USDA projection doesn’t include the cost of additional expenses such as college tuition.\n\nAs of 2021, the average cost of a four-year degree at a private university is $35,087, according to U.S. News. Average public, in-state tuition is $9,687. Both figures exclude room and board and are likely to be exponentially larger in 18 years.\n\nFor babies born in 2017, the total cost of attendance (including tuition and room and board) could be as high as $120,000 per year at a private four-year university and $54,000 per year at a public university, investment management company Vanguard tells CNBC.\n\nIf you plan to send your kids to college, you can start saving even before they’re born by investing in a 529 through a company like Backer. You can even use 529 savings before then if you decide to send them to a private instead of public school for their elementary or high school education.\n\nThe USDA’s projection also doesn’t include the cost of child care if both parents work or the cost of living on one income if one parent decides to stop working to raise the children.\n\nMany couples are undeterred by the costs. But according to The Atlantic, a growing number are choosing to have fewer children, delay starting families, or go child-free because of the costs involved in raising a family. So if you do want children, consider whether waiting a few years could realistically put you in a better place financially.\n\nIf you’re young and choose to delay children, investigate the costs involved in freezing your eggs or sperm now to avoid fertility issues down the road. But it’s feasible that could be more expensive than simply having kids now, depending on how long you plan to wait. And note that freezing eggs is costlier than freezing sperm.\n\nAlternatively, adopting your children may be a dream or a solution you come to if you’re unable to have your own. Adoption also involves costs you need to plan for.\n\n16. How Will You Spend Your Golden Years?\n\nThough it may seem far away, it’s not too soon to plan for your retirement. The power of compound interest means the sooner you start investing, the less you need to put away each month to reach your goals. Conversely, the longer you wait, the more you have to pull out of your budget to secure your financial future.\n\nDon’t wait until you reach your retirement years to talk about how you want to spend them.\n\nA 2018 Fidelity survey found that many couples nearing retirement age aren’t on the same page about their plans. A third of the respondents didn’t know or couldn’t agree on where they wanted to retire, a third didn’t know how comfortable they wanted their retirement years to be, and up to two-thirds didn’t know at what age they wanted to retire.\n\nYou need to talk dollars and cents, as it impacts how much you must put into your retirement accounts. But you should also talk about the kind of lifestyle you want to live in your golden years. Think about what you want your ideal retirement to look like.\n\nFor example, maybe you want to travel around the world, buy a second home near your children and grandchildren, or downsize and move somewhere warm and sunny. Though your plans will likely change as the years march on, talking about them now will help you financially plan for your future together as well as help ensure you’re both on the same page.\n\n17. How Will You Plan for the Worst?\n\nAnd now for perhaps the least sexy financial planning topic: How will you prepare for death? If the worst happens, you want to make sure the surviving spouse is financially protected as much as possible.\n\nOnce you merge lives and finances, the future you build together will become mutually dependent. If you’re relatively young — in your 20s or 30s — and have no minor children, you may not need life insurance to cover the deceased spouse’s missing income. But if you’re in any way dependent on your spouse’s income or have minor children to provide for, life insurance is worth considering.\n\nAnd getting life insurance can be easy and inexpensive. You can sign up in as little as five minutes with Bestow. Plans start at just $5 per month.\n\nIf you’re getting married at an older age and have accumulated significant assets, consider how you’ll pass those assets on to either your surviving spouse or any children.\n\nRegardless of your age, ensure you have advance directives in place. These include a living will, a durable power of attorney for finances, and a durable power of attorney for health care. Should you become incapacitated, these documents will either speak on your behalf or authorize the person of your choosing, most likely your spouse, to act on your behalf.\n\nAs you age, your end-of-life planning needs will change, so revisit this conversation regularly. In the meantime, you need to have at least an initial discussion about what should happen if the unthinkable occurs.\n\nPro Tip: Don’t procrastinate when it comes to life planning. Companies like Trust &amp; Will make the process simple. You can create a customized estate plan in just 10 minutes.\n\nKeep the Conversation Going\n\nTalking about money can be difficult. But it’s vital to the lifelong health of your relationship to speak regularly about your finances. You can’t simply have the money talk once and be done with it if for no other reason than that your lives together will continually shift, taking your finances along with them.\n\nOne way to keep the money conversation going is to schedule monthly or quarterly “money dates” where you openly talk about the current state of your finances, goals, and budget.\n\nIt’s best to set aside a time when you’re both ready and prepared to talk about money and nothing else because talking about money can lead to intense emotions. Having a regular money date makes it unnecessary to bring up a conversation about the credit card bill after someone’s had a long day.\n\nThe more proactive you can be, the better. Too many couples talk about money only when there are money issues, such as not having enough money to pay for an unexpected expense. That only serves to reinforce money conversations as difficult and stressful.\n\nSo talk about your budget and goals and make financial decisions before something becomes a sore point. And always remember that you’re a team. Refrain from judging or accusing and work together to find mutually acceptable solutions.\n\nTo keep the temperature in the room down, reframe the money conversation entirely. Instead of thinking about money in terms of problems you need to solve, think instead about planning all the wonderful things you have to look forward to, such as having kids, or the things you plan to do together, such as take a trip to Hawaii. That way, money feels less like a scarce resource than a tool you use to create your ideal lives.\n\nFinal Word\n\nAnswering so many money questions before getting married can seem daunting. But you don’t need to have all the conversations at once.\n\nAnd if any of these conversations become too difficult to have on your own, you can always head to a financial advisor. A financial planner, which you can find through SmartAsset, can help you create a plan and act as an objective third party.\n\nAnd fighting about money doesn’t mean you weren’t meant to be. Building a united financial front starts with one simple thing: a conversation.\n\n\t\t\n\n                                Marriage                            \n\n                                            Family &amp; Home                                        \n\n                                        Manage Money                                    \n\nSarah Graves\n\n\t\t\t\tSarah Graves, Ph.D. is a freelance writer specializing in personal finance, parenting, education, and creative entrepreneurship.

It’s been about two years since my last review, but much to my delight, I found we are following most of the steps well, and I just needed to update some numbers.\n\nStep 1: Making Peace With The Past\n\nDetermine your total lifetime earnings\n\nThe book was written before the Social Security Administration started sending out statements. If you have earned income all your life through regular jobs, this is extremely handy. I needed the numbers from my last review in 2004, Social Security statements, and our last tax return. The combined number for me and the Spousal Unit: $865,872.\n\nDetermine your net worth\n\nSo what do we have to show for all that moolah? Often, this is a depressing part of the assessment. Until recently, I came up in the negative, which is fairly common. For the last review, my net worth was a whopping $2,869. So. Add up assets: I include anything in the house that I could sell for cash, all bank accounts, current market value on the house, investments, etc. $316,183. Now for liabilities: the balance on the house, any other loans or credit card balances, and a tax debt from being a goob last year: $231,690. Net worth: $84,473. Hey! That’s not entirely bad. I can tell you this: most of that increase is because we stopped throwing money away on rent and bought a house.\n\nStep 2: Being in the Present; Tracking Your Life Energy\n\nThis is a touchy-feely way of asking how much sweat you put into the things you buy. It’s about learning to think of money as an investment of life.\n\nEstablish your real hourly wage\n\nYour hourly wage isn’t just gross earnings/40 hours per week: there are expenses in time and money involved in keeping a job, and it’s important to take those into account when calculating your hourly wage. The key is to add up all the expenditures you would not have if you didn’t have a job: work clothes, gas, lunch money, etc. Also add up hours outside the regular 40: overtime, commute, decompression. Bill works long hours and has a 70-minute bus commute. I have a shorter commute, and work just a little over 40 hours/week. He spends little on lunch, I spend a bit more. Neither of us buy special clothing. Between the two of us, we’re sweating out $35.23/hour. Doesn’t seem like much, eh?\n\nKeep track of every cent that comes into or goes out of your life\n\nSurprisingly, we’ve gotten pretty good at this. The debit card is easy to track, the only sticking point is allowances. We take out $100/week and split it 60/40 (I spend more on lunch, remember?), and tracking those little cash expenditures was something of a pain. We started out with a sheet on the kitchen counter that we would fill out when we got home, then I entered it in the budget spreadsheet at the end of the month. We kept the habit for a couple of months, then got slack. Now Bill is keeping track of this stuff in a spreadsheet, and I just let him know when I spend something. For some reason, this more casual system is working better so far. Expenditures are always broken into categories that are unique to us. These were determined not by guessing ahead of time, but by tracking expenditures for a few months, and then breaking things out into categories. The information is great to have–we can know at a glance if we’re over budget, and where.\n\nStep 3: Where Is It All Going? The Monthly Tabulation.\n\nEach month, get all that spending into a categorized table. Balance your incoming and outgoing. Then convert the amount spent in each category to hours of “life energy”–your real hourly wage. The idea is to see how much of your life you spend to buy books, movies, housing, etc. While we do the first two parts, and we review each category to see if we’re satisfied with the amount we’re spending, we don’t do the last step of “life energy” conversion. I did this conversion for a few months, just to get a feel for how much I was working for my spends. While I no longer find it necessary, it is a good step to do for a while, as it brings home the true cost of living.\n\nStep 4: Three Questions That Will Transform Your Life\n\n1. Did I receive fulfillment, satisfaction, and value in proportion to life energy spent?\n\nBy each category, mark a – if you didn’t get all the bang for the buck you’d like, a + if you would be happy spending more on this, and a 0 if it’s juuuust right. Follow the same procedure for each question. Our big minus at the moment is food out. Everything else is okay.\n\n2. Is this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my values and life purpose?\n\nOur expenditures are on track with our goals for the most part. We’d just like to be a bit more frugal, and add to our monthly charity spending as soon as we’ve cleared some debt.\n\n3. How might this expenditure change if I didn’t have to work for a living?\n\nThe goal of YMOYL is financial independence–especially from work. I like working. So does the Spousal Unit. We both have jobs in alignment with our values, and enjoy them very much. While we don’t share this goal with the book, it’s still a good question to think about. The answer for us is: very little.\n\nStep 5: Making Life Energy Visible\n\nCreate a wall chart plotting your total monthly income v. expenditures. In the book, the difference between these is supposed to be savings. I cheat a little, and add a savings line. The idea is to see your expenditures going down while your income goes slowly up. I love, love, love our wall chart. Our expenditure and income lines are still way too close together, but the savings is marching up the wall nicely.\n\nStep 6: Valuing Your Life Energy–Minimizing Spending\n\nThis step is certainly about frugality, but it’s also about awareness. Keep your real hourly wage in your head. When you pick up a DVD, do a quick calculation. Is it worth two hours of your life? This habit has become ingrained for me, and it’s been extremely useful. That doesn’t mean we’re perfectly frugal. I think the biggest thing we could do to minimize spending right now is cook, cook, cook.\n\nStep 7: Valuing Your Life Energy–Maximizing Income\n\nThis is not just about earning more money, it’s about giving your life energy for something that lines up with your goals and values. Think about what you get out of work. Money, sure. How about security? Community? Enjoyment? Are you squeezing your work hours for all they’re worth? The answer for both of us is a resounding yes, which we realize is a rare and fortunate thing in a world where most people have jobs they hate just so they can get by.\n\nStep 8: Capital and Crossover Point\n\nFigure out your total capital, multiply it by the current long-term interest rate (they use 30-year treasure bonds), and divide that by 12. That gives you your monthly investment income. This number goes on your wall chart. The crossover point is when it crosses your monthly expenditures, you’ve reached financial independence.\n\nAt the end of Lee Eisenberg’s The Number (review coming soon), the very rough assumption is that you can safely withdraw 4% of your investments to live on. This YMOYL step is about tracking your investments to see how close you are to, well, retiring. I’m not into retiring, but it’s still an inspiring step. One I admit I’d missed, but I’ve officially added it to the wall chart as of this month.\n\nStep 9: Managing Your Finances\n\nBecome knowledgeable about long-term income-producing investments. This is an ongoing process. When I first read YMOYL, I didn’t know a mutual fund from a wombat. Now I’m pretty sure one of them is a furry, ill-tempered critter. Which one I leave to your discretion.\n\nI read Your Money or Your Life after reading The Overspent American, and realizing I needed serious help. At the time I made about $24k/year, and would go to work in $400 suits. I couldn’t figure out why it was so darned hard to make the rent! I’ve come a long, long way since then. I’ve repaired my awful credit, de-cluttered, bought a house, and I’ve learned what stuff is really worth to me. It’s been a great journey. The Spousal Unit thinks I’m crazy for reading all these finance books and blogs, but my own progress has made the subject fascinating and inspiring. Here’s to next year’s YMOYL assessment.\n\n\t0\n\tshares\n\nMore about...Books, Budgeting\n\nCat Connor\n\nCat Connor, also known as Frykitty, was the second author at Get Rich Slowly.

I’m planning to reread YMoYL later this summer. The first time through, I simply absorbed the concepts, and didn’t actually do all of the exercises the book set forth. I think that maybe this time I’ll try to do what it suggests so that I can see just how much time each of those comic books costs me!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLarry Summers says\n\t\t\t\t16 June 2008 at 15:09\n\nbiolysis designation starling vernier anatifer acidproof gimlet hematogenic\n\nNORR Limited\n\n http://www.thesimsresource.com/\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tderrick says\n\t\t\t\t20 December 2009 at 00:34\n\ni think you misunderstood step 7.  the authors of YMOYL are not about ‘right livelihood,’ finding a job that means a lot to you.  they are about getting paid well for the time you spend working.  kind of the opposite\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAZ Joe says\n\t\t\t\t29 November 2013 at 05:13\n\nI agree, however, given Joe Dominguez’ goal of being FI so you have time to devote your life energy to things you love, I’m not sure he would disagree with Cat’s spin on #7 if it is fulfilling to her.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\nLeave a reply\n\n\t\t\t\tClick here to cancel reply.\t\t\t\n\nYour email address will not be published.

It was definitely her time to go. She leaked, she conked out at odd times, and she stank. Of course, I’m talking about our old vehicle: a minivan with 182,000 miles on it. I didn’t let go of her easily; after all, we didn’t get rid of our previous car until it had 264,000 miles on it. I figured we could get the minivan to at least 200,000.\n\nBut while visiting relatives in Florida, we had the opportunity to buy a used minivan from my sister’s meticulous neighbor for a great price. So we took it. I have to admit, it’s been a huge upgrade. It has all kinds of luxury features that our old minivan didn’t have, such as:\n\nWhen you turn it on, it stays on until you turn it off.\n\nWhen it rains, the water stays out of the vehicle.\n\nThere’s an electrical device in the cigarette lighter that I can use to charge my cell phone, rather than just an empty hole where an electrical device used to be.\n\nThe speedometer is an accurate reflection of the speed I’m traveling, rather than a number to which I have to add five to 15 mph.\n\nThe brake light comes on only when the emergency brake is actually engaged.\n\nIt has this thing called “air conditioning.”\n\nIt doesn’t stink. (The smell in the old car came from water coming in and getting the carpets all moldy.)\n\nIt has a “keyless remote,” which is a device on the key ring with buttons that, when pushed, cause the side doors to slide open.\n\n(Regarding that last feature, here’s a trick you can play on the uninitiated: I put the keyless remote in my pocket, and told my mom and my aunt that the doors were voice activated, but you had to use the secret word. In this van’s case, I told them, the secret word was “monkey _____.” Since this is a family website, I can’t print the actual word, but use your imagination and you’ll be close. So I got my 70-something mom and aunt to yell, “Monkey ____!” at the van, pressed the button in my pocket, and — voila! — the doors opened. They just couldn’t get over it. “I have to get me one of those!” my aunt exclaimed. I let them yell, “Monkey ___!” at the van for another 15 minutes, closing and opening the doors, until I told them the truth. If I had videotaped it, we’d all be YouTube heroes by now.)\n\nDrive a Lemon, Save Some Cabbage\n\nI take my share of barbs from family and friends for driving clunkers. But for me, there are two driving (no pun intended) factors: 1) money, and 2) safety. Let’s look at the first one.\n\nAt what point is repairing an old vehicle just throwing good money after bad? Here’s one way to look at it: According to Comerica Bank, creator of the Auto Affordability Index, the average cost of a light vehicle last year was $25,500. If you had to finance that total amount over four years at the going rate of 6.56% (according to Bankrate), it would cost you $605.44 a month. If you spend less than that on repairs of the old vehicle, then keeping it saves money…at least for the next four years. At that point, the newer car would be paid off, and the old car would be really old.\n\nBut in the meantime, if it cost you only $200 a month to maintain the old vehicle, you saved $405.44 a month, or $19,461.12 over four years. Not too shabby.\n\nWhile that’s helpful as a way to begin to think about the question, it doesn’t really help with determining a bottom-line number for an actual person because it’s based on an average number, 100% financing, and the purchase of a new car. To help someone like you — who is non-average, who likely wouldn’t finance the entire purchase, and who might be buying a “pre-owned” car (which, to me, is an inappropriate term, since “pre-owned” should mean “before it was owned,” that is, new) — you’ll have to whip out a spreadsheet and factor in all the costs. That includes assuming higher maintenance costs for the older car, but also higher insurance, higher property tax (if you, like me, live in a state that charges such things), and transaction costs after replacing your jalopy. It’s not an exact science, since it involves forecasting future maintenance costs — an impossible task. But it will give you some numbers to think about. In most cases, I bet the analysis will show that keeping the old car is the way to go, financially.\n\nBut then There’s Safety\n\nDid I do just such an analysis when I decided to replace our old minivan? Not exactly. We had reached a point where we were spending more than $2,000 a year on maintenance, and I had a rough idea of how much it would cost to fix the major problems with our van. Then this opportunity came up, to buy a van from one of those people who perform regular maintenance and have the records to prove it, at a price $2,000 to $5,000 below what it would have cost me to get the same vehicle from Craigslist or Carmax.\n\nBut what really got me was that the old van just didn’t feel safe anymore. Something was always going wrong, and I didn’t want something major to happen while my wife was on the highway with our kids. And I must admit, it’s nice to have a car that stays dry, has A/C, and doesn’t stink…yet. If I ran the numbers, I suspect my spreadsheet would have said, “Keep the old car.” But as readers of this website know, financial decisions don’t always come down to dollar and cents.\n\nSo I feel comfortable with the decision we made. As for our old van, my sister and brother-in-law got the major problems fixed and arranged to have it donated to a church they work with, so we’ll get a tax deduction out of the deal (another factor that would have gone into the spreadsheet) and the van will hopefully last long enough to do some good. My relatives in Florida approved of the trade-off, especially those who make jokes about the heaps we’ve driven, and believe that any car should be replaced once it reaches 100,000 miles.\n\nYet the math clearly shows that driving a car well beyond that point is the right thing to do for your net worth. According to Comerica Bank, the purchase of a new car costs 21.9 weeks of a median household’s income. That’s working 42% of the year just for a car. To me, acquiring a new vehicle before it’s necessary is a bunch of financial monkey _____.\n\n\t2\n\tshares\n\n\t2\n\nMore about...Transportation\n\nRobert Brokamp\n\nAs a former financial advisor and English teacher, it was inevitable that Robert Brokamp would one day write about the management of money.

I have a 97 Camry that is pushing 210k and I’ve been debating on whether to replace the car or not. Last year I spent $1600 on some major issues that came up and I have a feeling the next fix will be at a similar price range. My friends and family also make fun of me for driving such a clunker but I don’t mind. It gets me from point a to point b no problem. I have been thinking though that once the repair costs are greater than what the car is worth, it may be a good time to replace it with another used car.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTosaJen says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 05:47\n\nAs the owner of a 94 Toyota Corolla with 170k miles on it, I’m with you in keeping cars until they feel unreliable. I keep meaning to get a bumper sticker for it that says “No car payments since 1996.” There’s something to be said for not feeling particularly worried about the car being stolen or dinged, or having stuff spilled in it.\n\nEvery time we need something fixed, we set a maximum, so that we’ll have a good idea of when it will be time to retired the old girl. I keep hoping that my parents will decide to upgrade from their cream puff 2000 Honda Civic about the same time. 🙂\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMrs. Money says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 05:47\n\nI was driving a 1993 Oldsmobile Achieva until last year.  I truly loved that car and was sad when I had to get a new one. 🙁  I much prefer the old car to my new one that has a car payment!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tConnector says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 05:48\n\nThanks for including an article on when to replace your car. I’ve been pondering the question regarding\n\nJolly Green Gene (my car). JGG is a 96 Chrysler Voyager (the short version) with only 90,000 miles on the odometer. In 2009 I paid $6967 including all taxes, insurance, license fees, gas, and maintenance fees.\n\nI’d spoken to my insurance agent about whether replacing JGG with a recent-model (2003-5) used sedan was a good idea. He told me something wise: He said that since the insurance costs would be about the same, and since the mileage on JCG car was so low, it made much more financial sense for me to keep the car I have.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJames | Tech for the Masses says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 06:04\n\nRobert,\n\nGreat article and right on target.  I believe in driving your car into the ground and saving what you would of spent on a lease/car loan.  Then buying a certified used car outright.  Obviously over time you get small upgrades (in your case, a huge one!).  Nice job!\n\nJames\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCR says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 06:14\n\nThis is timely for me! I just picked up my 93 Volvo from the mechanic, after it died on me for the second time in 2 weeks at a busy intersection (although there are other cosmetic and comfort problems with it, it has never been unreliable). I am ready for a newer car, but we’re in the middle of trying to buy a house and car is the lower priority until we’re settled there. I know I am not going to like car payments, and that financially it still makes sense to fix the occasion problem, but I don’t like my car anymore! So, I’ve set myself a time frame of 4 months after we close on the house (which gives me time to find the car and save more for downpayment), and is close enough that I feel like I have a plan and can get my next car on my terms.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJoe M says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 06:26\n\nIt sounds like you’ve been driving with a major safety issue for quite a while and have chosen to ignore it.  Breathing in mold spores in a confined space is especially dangerous for children and “70-something” mom’s.  Saving money is great but it shouldn’t come at the expense of safety.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMinderbender says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 06:30\n\nOur children learned to drive in our Corolla, the same car they travelled around in their car seats in years past. My wife was driving our daughter and a friend once when the friend asked her how to get the window down. She was looking for the button-had never seen a crank handle to roll down the window.\n\nI usually try to buy 2-3 year old cars and drive them for a long time, though I did get a new car last year when prices were very low. Before that, the newest car in the family was a 2001.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tKaren says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 06:45\n\nWe just retired my husband’s 1992 Nissan Sentra. Last year we spent $2,600 in car repairs on it. The engine still worked; but everything else was falling apart. We decided in early December to go to one-car. We tested it first before making the commitment to bid good-bye to the Nissan. After a one month trial run, we decided that we can get by with one car. We also became members of ZipCar, just in case we both need a car at the same time. My husband works the mid-night shift, and I walk to work, so it hasn’t been that difficult to become a one-car family. We’re looking forward to only paying car insurance on one car, and only maintaining one car. It will make it easier to save for our next car. Our remaining car is a 2000 VW New Beetle with 116,000 miles on it–Runs great!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJonathan says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 06:47\n\nGreat article. Makes me feel much better about keeping my 20+ year old Corolla with over 180,000 kms for a while yet. Deep down I know it should be reliable for at least another 100,000 kms. \n\nI’ve tried to justify a new (second hand) car in my head many times from the whole ‘economy’ angle. Where getting a smaller car will eventually pay for itself through lower fuel/ maintenance costs. But when I do the sums even in my head, the break-even point is so far into the future that it’s far more cost effective to simply keep maintaining the car I have. \n\nEg. 25,000 kms/ year (the highest I’ve done!) Equals approx 2250L of fuel given my current efficiency. To get a car that is drastically more efficient, say 20% more efficient. I would only save approx $600/year on fuel. That’s a 10+ year pay off time. Simply not worth it.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBananen says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 06:54\n\nAre there any laws in the US on how broken down a car can be, before it’s illegal to drive it on public roads?\n\nI’m asking because we have some quite strict laws on this, which forces you to either spend a bunch on repairs, buy a new car or take the bus.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tKathy says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 06:54\n\nI absolutely enjoyed and agree with this article. I drive a ’92 Merc that my mom sold me for $1 a few years back. It’s got 90,000 miles on it and has been in a few wrecks, but all in all it’s a great car. And it’s going to help me attain my financial goals in the next two years. Yes, I get laughed at. I’ve gotten used to it and frankly I’m the one who is going to be chuckling when I’m debt-free someday down the road. I figure if I’ve spent less than $1,000 on it per year (last year I spent nothing!) it’s worth it!!! I love you Felix (the car haha). By the way, it just passed inspection the other day and the emissions are absolutely perfect. Ford/Lincoln Mercury can build a car.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAdrienne says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 06:58\n\nThe car thing has always been hard for me.  When really is the right time to say goodbye to an old car?  If I had a crystal ball for coming repairs it would make it easier.  The whole “feel safe” is more of an emotional thing (and can feel safe to one member of the family but not another).\n\nOn an up note just want to give a shout out to my 10 yr old Ford Taurus Wagon.  Bought 3 yrs ago for $4500.  Would never have bought a Ford Taurus except that I drove one for years as a company car.  Repairs have been minimal and inexpensive.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tEscapeVelocity says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 07:06\n\nIf I had a newer car, I would feel obliged to carry comprehensive insurance, which is another big price difference.  On the other hand, of course, if this car is totaled I don’t want to go out and buy another 14-year-old car, so it’s important to have some reserves on hand.\n\nOf course, how inexpensive a vehicle you can get away with depends on what you’re carrying around in it, particularly the size of ego.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTrini says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 07:06\n\nI’m all in favor or driving every last drop out of your car, but PLEASE maintain it and keep the emissions under control!  One of my biggest pet peeves are the cars on the road that leave a trail of chemical stink behind them.  That’s both rude and bad for the environment, and I wish more people would suck it up and fix or replace the car when it gets to that condition.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCharles says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 07:15\n\nYou should mention a common auto purchase philosophy, “drive it til it drops.” I’ve done this, it is quite economical. The idea is simple, buy a beater, something cheap like under $500, a car that passes safety inspection but that’s about all. Then do ZERO maintenance on it, except for replacing fluids (oil, coolant, trans fluid, etc). Then drive it til it stops running, sell it, and start again.\n\nI did this once, quite a few years ago, I bought an old 1967 Dodge Dart for $500, it was 15 years old at the time. It had a clogged up radiator so I flushed it once, and it ran for several years with zero maintenance. Best, cheapest car I ever owned.\n\nAnyway, the only downside to this is safety. Older used cars are always less safe than the latest modern cars. They can have bad brakes or poor steering, so you take a risk with an old car. I once saw a TV documentary that described the health risks of being poor, it asserted that the #1 health risk was auto accidents, because the poor can’t afford a safe car, just an old broken down, risky car.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tChris says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 07:18\n\nI have bought 1 new car.  Going on 12 years now without any major issues.  Still going great!\n\nI have bought 4-5 used cars (all of them “certified”).  All but one have had major issues within 1-2 years.  (over about 15 years)  \n\nWhen I added up all I spent on used car maintenance, I am 2-3x what I have spent on my 1 new car.  I keep trying, hoping to get the supposed savings, but replacing transmissions, engines, brakes, wheels, and everything else sure makes it difficult.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTim says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 07:20\n\nLiked the article. I kept my old civic until I felt it was unsafe and too small for my liking. It was great to have the extra cash around by not making payments and having reduced insurance. I was able to take some nice vacations and have some memories that will never fade.\n\nHowever, once the baby was on its way I wanted an updated car with better crash ratings, airbags, and better features (power windows). \n\nBottom line, I could have bought a cheaper car but if I am going to buy something that I will have around for 10-15 years I am going to buy what I want. This made me balance my desire for a low cost verses a desire for a luxury car. Ultimately, finding what was right for the family. Everyone sits on the low cost/luxury car line in a different spot for different reasons. However, where they sit is the right spot for them (as long as they can afford the vehicle).\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tmary b says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 07:23\n\nWe just went through this dilemma when my old Explorer would not pass inspection unless it basically got a new engine. So for us that was too pricey and it was time to say goodbye to it and get something else.  Found a great pre-owned mini van at auction which will hopefully last a while.\n\nBTW–I always thought “pre-owned” was short for Previously Owned.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAmi Kim says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 07:34\n\nSo long as we can maintain our cars and stay ahead of the amount it would cost to make a car payment, we’re going to do it.\n\nFor those who decide to stick things out, aside from mechanical maintenance, it’s worth it to splurge on a complete interior/exterior clean/shampoo/detail.  Having your car look/smell nice and shiny helps maintain the right mindset for keeping an old faithful friend.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSuzanne says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 07:37\n\n@11: I think car maintenance laws vary by state.  When I lived in Connecticut I had to have my car officially tested by the DMV every year or two – and it was rigorous!  You had to be able to open all doors from the inside and outside, use the wipers, lights, etc. \n\nNow that I’m in Chicago I think I’ve had to have my car tested once in 6 years and that was just for emissions.

My car was brought brand new 10 years old and has about 60,000 miles on it (100k km). It runs great and I do regularly maintenance every 3-6 months (oil change, fluids, etc.) and every once in a while I’ll spend real money to get a filter replaced or the rad flushed.  It looks great, no models replaced it (discontinued) so it will always look like the newest version. Due to these factors, I’m driving it til it falls apart.\n\nThe biggest problem I have is what everyone else thinks of it. “You’re rich, why do you drive that? Where’s your Mercedes?” Bah.

In PA, we require both yearly emissions and inspection…but emissions requirements vary by individual county.\n\nIt sort of amazes me how a lot of people ignore glaring safety issues with their vehicles or try to pass off inspections by a thread in the name of being cheap.  If you have a nagging suspicion that your car is unsafe to YOU but you refuse to perform maintenance, you’re also being a menace to other drivers.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCdoc says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 07:59\n\nI agree with keeping a car around as long as it is safe, reliable and in good working condition.  (smelling bad and no AC would have to go)  I’ve always had a long commute so reliability is important to me.\n\nI like to buy new and drive them as far as they can go.  I get a 5 yr loan.  When the loan is up, I keep making payments (to myself or on a car for my wife).  I figure if I can get another 5 years out of the car it has paid me back.  I’ll always have 1 car payment, I’m just trying to avoid 2.\n\nI’m more a fan of new cars than used though.  I’ve tried to look at cars that are a few years old.  It always seems like they want too much for used cars.  This is especially true on cars like Honda and Toyota that hold their resale value well.  I remember looking for a used Sienna and finding that ones that were a couple years old were selling for more than what the new one I wanted (I didn’t want leater, navigation etc but the only used ones I saw had these features)\n\nPurchasing a used car also takes a lot more time to find the right one.  Every new honda civic is essentially the same no matter which dealer you chose but every used car is unique.  I’ve had luck w/ private sellers in the past but I haven’t been able to find what I want recently.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSam says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 08:04\n\nYou can also rent cars for long trips or when you need a nice car when family comes to town.

This year we will put in new shocks &amp; may have it done by the local school to save more money.  Then I’m going to take the old girl to the car detailing place &amp; have it cleaned inside &amp; out.  It will look great.  Heck, we’ve saved so much money this year on transportation that we can pay cash for a trip to Costa Rica and are still put away more money than when we were driving two cars.  I really suggest to people that they drive one car.  It is a huge money saver.  We don’t have access to zip car but even with the occasional rental we save big.  Last year we spent $600 on car rental and about $300 on bus, trains &amp; cabs.

By mentioning that they will not like having to live with car payments. \n\nMaybe I am making the assumption that because you drive an older/paid for car, you’re debt free. For some I am sure that is not the case and you simply can only scrape by with that kind of vehicle. But for most did you not think you’re car will eventually run out of steam?\n\nIf you’re keeping a car for an average of 10 years even $50 a month into a car fund would result in a 6K+interest car paid for in cash. After 10 years a 6K car (likely 3-5 year old car that ran ~15-20K new) is going to feel like a huge leap in safety and comfort.\n\nHonestly maybe it’s just me. I am a car guy. I would buy two new cars every year if I could afford it. But we have made a decision to live debt free (except the house). We live on a budget, (as I am sure most people reading this site do or at least are interested in doing)  we are lucky that we have a good positive cash flow every month. We make our car payments to ourselves. So when the urge hits (not because the car was run into the ground) I can find what I want and purchase it. Is that the smartest financial decision vs. driving a car into the ground. No, does it make me happy to know every 4-5 years I can pay cash for a newer fun car yes.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPeter says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 08:30\n\nWhat about safety. I am sure the newer vehicles have better safety goodies installed than the older vehicles. But how old is safe is something worth discussing. I am not an expert on this one. But I had like to have some one comment on this.\n\nFor example, a 2006 Ford may have more or less same set of safety features as a 2010 Ford, but definitely not the same as 1990 Ford.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPreston says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 08:33\n\nI currently drive a 2001 Chevy Cavalier that I paid $100 for.

He is the type who thinks replacing a car about once every year or two is a necessity. He is 26 and has had 8 cars, from clunkers to brand new. His old 2001 Jeep just turned over 90,000 miles, and in his eyes it was falling apart. It needed $1800 in repairs according to him, but it still ran fine.\n\nHe caught car fever in mid-January and bought a 2004 Grand Prix with 92,000 miles two weeks later. I don’t think my friend has ever paid off a loan in full. He goes from car to car and rolls over thousands on each loan (four loans in total). He supposedly bought the car for $6000, plus a 2-year extended warranty (dumb!), plus tax, title, and fees. He is paying a whopping 19% interest with his 500 credit score, anchored by a bankruptcy. His payments are $350 for 41 months. After a quick calculation (that he probably didn’t do) he is paying $14350 for a car that will be worth $4000 or less, and have 150,000 miles by the time he pays it off.  The dealer is laughing all the way to the bank (the bank is laughing too). I strongly advised against this purchase, but there was no changing his mind. You are really in a bad place, and the dealer has ALL the power when you still owe money on an old loan. If he would have only saved that $350 a month for a year or so he could have had $4000 saved towards a used car, and could have sold his jeep and could have a $0 payment for the next 3 years. He lives, but he doesn’t learn.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMylegs says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 08:58\n\nWe have new cars that are both now paid off–06 and 08.  Prior to that we had used ones that were money pits.  I felt they were safe and certainly the money that we spent on them was less than what the car, properly fixed up, was worth.  However, one thing that I haven’t really seen much comment about was the “hassle factor” involved in fixing an older vehicle.  There’s time and worry involved in diagnosis, shopping for the best service and price, having the repair done, and the inconvenience of not having a car.  And then there’s the time spent worrying that something else will come up and leave you stranded.\n\nOpportunity cost should be factored in here.  We’ll drive our new cars until they reach the point where the “value” of them–actual value, needed repair, and the “hassle factor”–is just about zero.  But folks should take into consideration that last factor and give it some $$ value.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\twendy says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 09:03\n\nhmmm, my guess is monkey MADNESS? no? ok, monkey BUSINESS? well, i just can’t think what it might be…\n\nanyway, i have a 10 year old nissan sentra that is at about 175K miles.  it’s been a wonderful car, and my 2nd sentra.  my husband’s titan, however, we bought used a couple of years ago and appears to be a lemon.  we will be trading it in, as we need a vehicle for our year-long road trip.  great post!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCraig says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 09:08\n\nI waited till my car literally died before getting a new one.

Still a large amount, right?\n\nWRONG, these arguments always forget a tiny fact a car is an asset (a fast depreciating asset, but it is still one).  Your $25k car with 48,000 miles will be worth between $10k and $15k depending on make/model and your care of it.  Meanwhile your rusty and falling apart beater will be worth a couple hundred to the junkyard.  Meaning driving your dangerous and outdated car saved you just a couple grand.  For many people $100 a month is a small price to pay for having a safe and reliable vehicle and the joy that comes with seeing a car as more than just an A to B method.\n\nI prefer to buy a greatly discounted new vehicle or 1 year old used vehicle with cash and trade it in for another in 4-5 years.

If his car needed frequent repairs he would not only be extremely inconvenienced by the time he would have to take to drop off the car and get the estimates, etc., but he would have to rent a car in order to continue working for the next few days.  And that’s not counting the fact that it would be very likely he would miss or have to reschedule appointments because of the time spent at the garage – and that means lost income.\n\nFor people who have a 9-5 job, this may not be a big deal – just call the boss and tell him you have car trouble.  For the self-employed who really rely on their car as their means of seeing clients, an old, unreliable car can be a real detriment.

But if you’re doing it just because you’re cheap you should re-evaluate.  There are things you can live with and things you can, but shouldn’t.  The radio went out, big deal.  That isn’t going to compromise safety.  But a speedometer going out?  Your kids got glue on the seat, that’s nothing.  But mold in the upholstery?\n\nIf it’s still running fine then why not get these things fixed (other than you are that cheap)?  If something on my dash went out my car guy would go to pick-n-pull and get a whole newish one for a few dollars, $100-200 and it’s functional again.  If it leaked my husband would go to town with epoxy (and it would probably be more structurally sound than when we bought it).  As for the mold, if I couldn’t clean it I would just replace the car because life is too short to drive a smelly and allergy aggravating car.  \n\nBut the one-up people do with how old and junky their car is seems more cheap than frugal.  That isn’t to say that you should buy new and trade it in after 5 years or 50k miles.  But, for example, my 01 Explorer is nearing 100k miles, so I set aside money every paycheck for a new one (and/or repairs).  She’ll get new belts, hoses and everything flushed this year and then I’ll run her until she starts having mechanical problems.  In four years I will have enough to buy a very nice 2-3 year old replacement.  If she’s still running, great.  But if she needs repairs or if there are a number of comfort issues, then I’ll just let her die a peaceful death. \n\nJust like everything there are trade-offs, and I don’t see the virtue in keeping a vehicle that long.  At that point it seems you’re just making at your own expense, cutting off your nose to spite your face as it were.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDan says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 09:52\n\nI drive a ’99 Chevy Malibu with 128,000 miles on it.  It’s served me well, and truthfully, I’ve only had to put $2500 or so into it (beyond fluids and oil changes) since I bought in in 2001.  It’s starting to show its age, however, and the state in which I currently reside wants $2000 in repairs to meet the inspection standards.  (I cheated and registered it in a different state that has no such rules.)\n\nMy car runs well enough, doesn’t die at idle, and I don’t worry about not getting it started or stranding me on the side of the road.  My real question comes down to throwing good money after bad… do I make those repairs just to have a bunch more next year?  At the time my car failed inspection, I figured I would just keep the fluids and oil clean, and when it died, it died.\n\nBut here’s the rub: This is my commuter car.  I drive 13 miles round trip to work, and put less than 4000 miles on it each year.  At that rate, I’ve got 15 years before I reach 180,000 miles.  Do I really think I’ll keep it 15 years?  Probably not.  But I am reasonably sure I’ll have the same commute for the next 5 years, and it’s reasonable for me to keep it at least that long.\n\nI’m now starting to rethink my plan to let everything slide.  What “normal” people put on their car in three months, I put on in a year.  I don’t expect a bunch of things to start breaking within the next 4000 miles.  If $2k-$3k in repairs now keeps this thing going for 5 more years, it’s likely worth it, even though blue book on this thing is only $1000.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCrystal says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 09:53\n\nI seem to be a in a different category…I hate errands like getting the car repaired.

It’s a wash paying for the rental.  This shouldn’t be an excuse to not maintain the car OR to keep financing new ones.\n\nWe went for four years with one car.  I was able to walk to work at the time. On average I rented a car four weekends a year.  An enormous savings if walking or public transportation are reasonable options.\n\nBoth our vehicles are paid off, and desirable models, but neither is an “asset.”  The Kelly values on each are less than 25% the cost of a new model, so to buy a new Accord, we’d have to trade both of these things in and then dump a pile of cash on top.  \n\nI agree that saying you’re driving something “into the ground” can really mean “I’m doing zero maintenance, on this and on everything else.” I keep well away from cars that look ill-maintained, because a careless attitude toward maintenance all too often indicates a careless attitude toward driving skills/traffic laws as well.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tRMS says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 10:52\n\nI love hearing everyone’s car stories.  I loved my old 1995 Corolla, and it worked well for the city.  However, I really enjoy driving my new car as well.\n\nI bought the 95 Corolla in 2004 for $2,700, and traded it in at the dealer for a brand new Impreza for $1,500 in 2009.  Between 2004 and 2009 I was in a minor accident where the at-fault insurance company paid me about $1,200 but it only cost me $300 to fix (because I didn’t care about the paint job.)  So in some ways I only paid for car insurance over the course of 5 year.  \n\nI miss the savings with the Corolla, but now I have a new car that is appropriate for my outdoor adventures.  I was going to buy a used Impreza but like some other people said, the used car wasn’t that much cheaper than the new one (in 2009).\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTyler Karaszewski says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 11:06\n\nWe will be replacing my wife’s car this year because we decided we needed one of your new luxury features as well: “When it rains, the water stays out of the vehicle.” Not sure if we’ll get a brand new car or a used one, but either way, I plan on paying cash.\n\nPersonally, my car still feels pretty new to me, it’s a 2007 with less than 50k miles on it.

My sister (who drove it to high school until we could afford car insurance in Boston) had dented the front part.  During a big blizzard (long story) we hit a pole that part fell off.  Cosmetic damage only.  But we failed the annual safety inspection and the cost to repair was more than the car would have been worth without damage.  When we looked into donating the car nobody would even take it for free.\n\nSince we were hoping to start a family and planned to move to the South, we’d been planning to get a car with 4 doors and a/c anyway, but the accident moved that up a year.  Given my preference for new cars, we only had enough saved to get… another Hyundai Accent.  Financing didn’t even cross our minds as something we could do.\n\nIt looks kind of funny next to all the other professors’ Honda Accords and minivans… and the students’ F150s-F450s and BMWs, but it works for me.

We might be getting a bigger vehicle but cars could easily go another 5-10 years.\n\nIf you buy and hold, the cost is a lot less due to:\n\n– skipping sales tax on every transaction\n\n– lower insurance including eliminating collision\n\n– lower registration fees\n\n– less washing &amp; waxing\n\n– minimal depreciation after 7 years\n\nIf you live in the Southern half of the country vehicles last forever.\n\nI suggest buying a car that you absolutely love used and holding it for at least 10 years.  If you love it, you are less likely to want to trade up.\n\nFlipping 2 cars every 3 years is as expensive as a mortgage on a $200,000 house.

My 99′ Nissan Maxima is just shy of 200,000, but it still runs great. For those who enjoy DIY type of work, a lot of issues can be fixed for very little money. My A/C was also not working and the dealer wanted over $200 dollars to “re-charge” it. I bought a can of Arctic Freeze A/C recharge from walmart for $10 bucks and it’s good a new. $10 dollar fuel filter replacement as well. I know DIY isn’t for everyone, but if that type of thing interests you it makes it much easier to justify keeping a car longer and saves you LOTS of money. \n\nMy Maxima could probably go over 300,000 miles based on the condition of the engine, but body of the car is rusting rapidly so I will probably only get 1 or 2 more years out of it. Safety comes first, once that is gone so is the car.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDave says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 11:48\n\nMy commute is 6 miles round trip.  My vehicle is a ’94 and I paid $300 for it.  The engine is good – it seems to get stronger every day!  The EPA rating is second to none, and I’ve spent less than $50 in repairs and maintenance in the past 3-4 years.  I can do most of the work myself.  A/C works great; well, it’s a convertible – so rainy days require some pre-planning, but no biggie.  I install studded tires for winter commuting so I can get around on icy roads. It hauls me to and from work and I never worry that it will leave me stranded by the side of the road.  It’s a model I’d highly recommend, but like many other vehicle models this particular one has been discontinued.  If I keep washing it when it’s dirty and keep it maintained it should last another 5-8 years before I have to replace it.

If you are, repairs are necessary and a big time sink. \n\nBut if you bus or bike for your commute, and do most of your errands within walking distance, the car is just a nice luxury – if our car wouldn’t start and we were busy that day, we’d just get it fixed next week. Whatever. \n\nCars are a huge time and money sink if they’re a necessity in your life.

The example Robert gives of a $25,000 car results in monthly payments of around $605 for 4 years. Then he compares that to spending $200/month on repairs. But that assumes you’re only going to keep the new car for 4 years. (Granted, he mentions the possiblity of keeping it longer, but that’s not factored into the analysis.)\n\nIf you assume you’re going to buy new and keep it for say ten years, you can spread that cost over 10 years then effectively it only costs you $240/month. So I’d argue that if you’re spending $200 on repair bills you’re spending too much money to keep an old car.\n\nGood article and I like the principle behind it, but I think it could be a little misleading on the true cost of keeping a clunker around.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tKari says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 14:56\n\nAfter reading the comments I think I’ve got everyone beat as to the oldest car.

In 2005 I parted with my 150k mileage 1989 Nissan Stanza.  Great little car, everything worked (sunroof, windows, etc), upholstery was in great shape, etc.  But the car just wasn’t that safe as I found myself driving on the interstate more often.  It also wasn’t quite as comfortable as it used to be either.  \n\nSo I sold it and bought a safer, nicer car in Aug 2005.  I paid cash for the Acura I bought and of course, got quite an upgrade in every aspect of car ownership (safety, luxury, horsepower, etc).  I’m still driving this Acura (currently at 107k miles).\n\nThe best thing about older cars is they are usually paid for, have reasonable insurance (although a really old car is less safe and a bit more to insure in some cases), and you know what to expect when you’ve owned that car for a number of years.  It isn’t like the 1995 Explorer my dad bought when they were recalled back in the day, or my husband’s new Camry (recall), or Mom’s 2008 Avalon (recall).  I know what works on my car and what to expect.  Plus I save oodles of money driving a car I paid for with cash.  \n\nSome people argue that you spend a lot in repairs.  I probably did spend about $3000 in non-routine repairs on my Stanza over the years.  That’s $250 a year (over the 12 years I owned it) or $21/month.  My Acura has so far cost me about $250 (oil leak) in non-routine repairs over the 4.5 years I’ve owned it.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJupe Blue says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 15:10\n\nHere’s a question for anyone who has read to this point in the comments.  \n\nWhen is time to get rid of an old car?

Over the last twenty years, my husband and I bought at least four such used cars, and saved tons on lower property taxes, auto insurance, and depreciation.  We thought it was worth the extra hassle of frequent and costly repairs, but all that changed one day when I was driving one of these SUV’s down a steep hill and had a total brake failure without warning.  The emergency brake was worthless, too, so I ended up driving into a wall at 50 MPH to avoid crossing traffic at an upcoming intersection.  That resulted in a 360 degree rollover.

No. Do they ease the overall driving experience and add value to the vehicle? Indeed they DO.\n\nIt’s really all subjective and up to the individual, but I feel that Robert made a great decision, for like J.D. often says “Finances are more about the mind than the math.”\n\nEnjoy Your Ride Robert 🙂\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMegan says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 23:08\n\n“Monkey s***!  Monkey s***!”\n\nOur car stinks, too, for the same reason.  But only when it’s rained for a few days going.  It’s a 94 Chrysler LHS, with kid-friendly leather seats.  We’ve had it for 4 years this month, and we paid $1200 for it.  (Divorce special.  The wife just wanted it out of her sight, poor lady.)  Since then, we’ve replaced the tires and replaced the brakes (ourselves, with the help of some friends.)  That means, excluding regular maintenance like oil changes, we’ve put a total of $1700 into her, which translates to $35.42/month.  MPG could be better, but the price we paid more than makes up for it.  And b/c she’s so old, we can get by with the lowest amount of insurance coverage, which comes out to $20/month (we have squeaky clean driving records and comprehensive medical, two other factors that keep premiums low.)\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMegan says\n\t\t\t\t03 February 2010 at 23:33\n\nOh, and I don’t understand why anyone driving a paid-for beater would assume that they would have car payments with their next car?  You have so many options.  You could find a decent used one for $1k-$3k, or anticipate spending a little more and stocking a car savings account before the day comes.\n\nMe, I don’t think I’ll ever spend more than $3k for a car.

I personally like to get a few year old car with all the options for 50-70% off the original cost.\n\nBuy what you can afford, start saving for the next car, and maintain the car(s) you currently have.\n\nI don’t see what causes the car topic to be so confusing or different!

My 10 year old car went into the mechanic on Monday with what I thought were some small problems – turns out they were symptoms for several very large problems.  To fix all of them (all of them impacted the safety of the vehicle) would have cost about the same as the value of the car itself.  And then I thought – well, what happens if another major repair is needed within a few months?  \n\nThere are moments when the ability to drive to work without the worry of breaking down take precedence over other financial goals.  We’ll still make it all work, just a bit less to the debt snowball than we hoped.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tKevin says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 11:16\n\nI think the “safety” issue is a strawman.  Let’s be honest – any car built within the last decade, and properly maintained, is sufficiently “safe” for transporting your loved ones.  Furthermore, I’d venture your odds of walking away from a collision are a lot better in a 10-year old Intrepid than any brand-new Smart ForTwo, Mini Cooper, or Toyota Yaris, regardless of how many more airbags the newer cars may boast.\n\nIn my opinion, anyone citing “safety” is merely rationalizing a desire for something shiny and new.  If you want a new car because you just plain want a new car, then that’s fine, but at least be honest about it.  Don’t try and snow me with BS about “safety.”  You’re not fooling anyone.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tmark says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 11:20\n\nMy philosophy, which has served me quite well, is to buy used, but high quality vehicles. In my opinion, there are only two makes of high-quality vehicles that are a great value, and those are Honda and Toyota.\n\nThe majority of those vehicles, I would bet anything, will last 10+ years and 200k+ miles with nothing but an oil change once every 8k miles, and the occasional minor repair bill.\n\nThose cars are designed to last 200k+ miles, while the Chevy’s and, until recently, Fords, are mostly junk. And that goes for all the other high-maintenance junk (ask Consumer Reports), like Volkswagen, Nissan, Cadillac, etc. Are there exceptions within these lines? Yes. But resale is another thing to factor. For that reason, it’s Honda or Toyota all the way for me.\n\nI saw on cnn today that resale values on Toyota have dropped 10% because of the recent recalls. This is ridiculous, but if true, then they are an even better value right now!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tShara says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 11:32\n\n@Kevin\n\nIf you read through these posts 10 years is a fairly *new* car.  I agree about any car built within the last decade, the majority of which are going to have between 100k and 150k miles.  I think that is a perfectly reasonable time to get rid of a car.  Most of the safety comments appear to me to be to people putting 200k+ miles on 20 year old cars.\n\nAnd I would put just about anything up against those tiny cars with non-existent crumple zones.  Air bags just can’t beat the pure physics of deceleration in a crash situation.  You need distance over which to decelerate or the force on your body is such that you just can’t avoid injury or death.  In my mind it’s worse than driving without insurance.  In the unlikely event that you’re in a bad crash you don’t risk paying for a car, you risk your life.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tEd says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 12:06\n\nIt took 45 posts to come up with one of the factors I considered important.  The TIME it takes to go get the car fixed.  It usually involves finding two drivers and two cars to go drop one off get picked up, get dropped off again when the repair is done.  Not fun or easy.  \n\nI also recommend the trusted mechanic, you can avoid unecessary repairs and be warned of future repairs coming up.\n\nI usually buy a car new and drive it to the ground.  I feel it is better to know how the car was taken care of in the first few years of its life.  It can make a difference in how long it will last.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMarian says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 12:09\n\nA few thoughts about safety.  My son-in-law’s father was driving his Mini Cooper &amp; was struck by an SUV at a light.  My in-law walked away &amp; the Mini-Cooper had less damage than the SUV.  Those Mini-Coopers are built by BMW and are very heavy for their size.  Also, to the guy who’s wondering about fixing the brakes….if you need new brakes, go to a school &amp; get them done.  Or if you’ve got no cash but any wiggle room on a credit card this is one purchase I’d go into debt for.  If you are absolutely broke, either give up the car or borrow the money from friends or family.  AND THEN PAY IT BACK!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tShara says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 12:28\n\n@Marian\n\nI really depends on the speed of the crash and the mass of the vehicles (Force=mass*acceleration).  I worry not so much about damage to the car but damage to the person in a high speed crash.  You can argue that a small %age of crashes are high speed crashes.  That is a valid argument depending on how comfortable you are with personal risk.  But the smaller cars make me uncomfortable.  \n\nManufacturers give up weight to make their cars more economical, but the trade-off is in structural integrity (thinner metals, different materials, etc) and that F=ma equation.\n\nBut you’re right, if you look at the numbers the Cooper is actually quite heavy for its size.  From what I understand they are very well made.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMike says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 14:27\n\nI’m driving a 2005 focus with ~100,000 miles on it. I bought it in Jan of 2006 with 23K miles on it. Only one minor repair so far: a $50 shift solonoid. I do the regular maintenance, but other than that I pretty much neglect the poor thing. After financing/down payment was all said and done, my monthly payment is about $215/month. At the end of this year it will be paid off.\n\nUntil recently I had a very long commute to/from work and then to school at night. Hence the 30mpg Focus. I just did the math and had I gone with a car in the 17MPG range, it would have cost me about $100/month extra in gas. I have kind of been hit with the new car (well new truck) bug recently since I’m a lot closer to my new job, but this post and the comments is making me reconsider.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tNicole says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 14:58\n\n@Shara– for crashes that aren’t head on, there’s other factors at play than just weight and density of materials.  When our Honda Civic got clipped by an F150, the bumper popped right off and I didn’t feel a thing, not even a tremor.  My mechanical engineer sister was marveling at the design when she came and rescued me (she brought some ties for the flaps and stuck the bumper in my backseat so I could drive back home)… something about it dissipating the energy by popping off.\n\nI would imagine there’s design things they can do in head-on crashes as well depending on how and where they brace things.  (But I haven’t done any physics since high school.)  Cars that are the same mass might be able to handle head on crashes differently than rear end crashes depending on where they put that mass and how they design bracing.  (I’m vaguely recalling high school experiments designing bridges out of popsicle sticks.)\n\nMaybe a real engineer could chime in on that.  I do think newer smaller cars are better at these engineering design aspects even if older cars are heavier (since they’re made out of metal).  I don’t know how different the engineering is in bigger card and smaller cars these days, if they have different requirements or what.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMarie says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 15:06\n\nRegarding the “down time” for older vehicles, we’ve solved this by having three cars for two people. No, hear me out.\n\n* We got the third car for a song from my parents, who were the original owners.\n\n* The extra insurance is $25 a year.\n\n* We’ve learned how to do a lot of repairs for which the labor cost was the highest factor–the part wasn’t that expensive. We’ve taken off the dashboard and fixed vents, replaced turn signals, and done belts and hoses several times over the years.\n\n* Because we had another car to fall back on, there was no hurry to get things done whatever the cost. We researched, shopped online, and checked junkyards for parts.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPeter says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 15:38\n\n@Marie I’ll second the extra car advice.  We have an old 1986 F250 for work stuff around our property.  It’s only worth about $1500 at this point and only adds ~$50/yr to our insurance.  \n\nProbably doesn’t work for everyone, especially considering many people are limited on parking.  However old cars (yes, even American) are pretty reliable if you remember to drive them once every other month or so!\n\nYou’re also helping the environment by owning two cars!  A small car for commuting + a rarely used older full size pickup is lower impact than driving one larger SUV around everywhere…\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJill says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 15:58\n\nOur rule of thumb is to buy new, and then once the car gets to about 130K miles, it’s assumed to be operating under a vehicular DNR order- if it’s looking like the car will need more than $2500 worth of repairs in the near future, or we’re inching toward that amount in a short time frame, then it’s time to get rid of it and buy a new car.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSindre says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 16:02\n\n@Shara\n\nActually mass isn’t everything, inspite of what your physics knowledge tells you. A well designed car will actually help a lot. Take a look at this youtube video from Fifth Gear for reference (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3ygYUYia9I) that was a big eye-opener for me. \n\nHaving said that I’m driving a 1984 Mazda with only 52 000 miles on it, that hopefully will keep me until I’ve saved enough for a new car. That car is not safe by modern standards and that means I drive defensively. For most drivers that reduces your chances of collisions as much as modern safety features. It’s also a very “direct” car, with no anti-lock brakes or power steering I know when it’s slippery as I can feel it and drive accordingly f. inst.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tShara says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 16:02\n\n@Nicole\n\nAbsolutely, there are a lot of things that go into safety.  I was speaking specifically of crumple zones (btw, i said change in acceleration which should have been change in velocity which IS acceleration).  You are right that in a head on collision a small car of today is still going to out perform a boat from 30 years ago because the boat isn’t going to have the crumple zones.  In a rigid structure there will be close to as much force because there is no time/distance for the change in velocity.  Not to mention the crumple of the hood rather than having it pushed back to cut you in half.\n\nMy point was that by getting rid of the hood and trunk areas a lot of the super compact vehicles have no way to compensate for the abrupt change of velocity of a front impact collision, hence very high acceleration which means very high force, which may mean death.  If you can extend that change in velocity over 2 feet instead of two inches you may have just saved your life.\n\nBut of course not all, in fact not a majority, of accidents are front impact (though if memory serves me they are the most deadly).  And just like not wearing your seat belt, there will be occasions where being in the lighter vehicle will be a net plus.  But I would not choose one for myself.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCars4Charities says\n\t\t\t\t04 February 2010 at 17:15\n\nIf you’re tired of constantly repairing your old car, please consider donating your car to charity.

And these were just the issues that required an immediate fix (not counting the hole in the exhaust and replacing two belts).\n\nSometimes, repairs really can be needed that make trading in an older vehicle a requirement.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFat Bob says\n\t\t\t\t05 February 2010 at 15:43\n\nI calculate what the car costs me per year to drive and then I calculate the same numbers for a hypothetical new car.  If the new one is comparable and I like it then I buy it.\n\nTo get the cost/year I add up depreciation, insurance, maintenance, gas and opportunity costs for the upcoming year.  I don’t count car payment costs since I pay cash and I don’t take account of costs associated with trading in my old car and buying from a dealer because I buy and sell with private parties.\n\nDepreciation is probably around 15-20% of the current value – you can get a better estimate from edmunds.com.  I get the rest from my records.\n\nMy car ends up costing me ~3k/year, which I’d guess is cheap.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tKaren says\n\t\t\t\t07 February 2010 at 08:37\n\nI am on a new adventure of keeping my car for as long as I can.  I am an itinerant teacher, and I drive a lot. If my car doesn’t work, I have to cancel students and it becomes a big hassle.  I am also a single woman who doesn’t have backup if my car breaks down.  So I have always felt like I needed a reliable car, and I have always gotten new cars between 90 and 100,000 miles. I almost replaced my 2003 Mazda MPV a year ago, at 100,000 miles.  I had spent about $3000 on repairs and maintainence, and that worried me.  But I didn’t buy a new car and I am so glad.  At first, I decided to wait until the snow melted and the salt washed away.  When it did, I didn’t care about getting a new car anymore.  My car still feels solid, safe, and reliable, except for some developing rust.  In the last year, the only extra maintanence I have done is new brakes.  In the meantime, I have been saving my car payments and mileage, and I now have enough to buy a new small car.   I have freedom to bail at any time, and I established limits on how much I will do to maintain my car, e.g., no new engines or transmissions. I am now at 121,000 miles and every additional mile is a gift.  I have noticed that my engine is using more oil (a quart every 3000 miles) so I have to watch that.  But I have a wonderful mechanic, and that helps.  My engine light went on last summer, and he cleaned the oxygen sensor, and didn’t charge me.  I avoided a $200 repair bill.  He also inspected the engine for oil leaks and made sure the transmission was fine and didn’t charge me anything.  \n\nI appreciate hearing from all of you who have gone before me in keeping cars as long as possible.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAnita says\n\t\t\t\t08 February 2010 at 14:23\n\nWhat about car sharing?  It’s just starting to pick up in major cities.\n\nMy husband &amp; I both come from “keep ’em until they’re really done” families.  In our families, 100K miles is just getting started, and parting with a car before 200K is just wasteful.  Of course, with that attitude preventative maintenance is a must. \n\nWhen our Mazda 626 needed $700+ in immediate repairs with more on the way because we weren’t as diligent with the regular maintenance as we should have been, we parted with it around 150K (oh, the shame!).\n\nWe’re now living as a one car family.  We’re carpooling and plan to use a car sharing cooperative for a second car as needed.  It’s a great way to move through the useful life of a car more efficiently than the sparse use a single family gets from their cars.  Materials and energy required to to produce a new car as well as landfill to junk or energy to recycle the old one are saved just like when you keep your own for 20 years, but you also get to stay on top of the latest in safety and environmental advances because other people are helping to move through the miles on any individual vehicle quicker!  In short, it seems like a very efficient use of resources.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tsphinsa says\n\t\t\t\t24 February 2010 at 12:55\n\nI have a different situation. I got married in 2007. I had a beater(85 bought in 2002 for 600 no ac doors didn’t lock window was stuck half down) that I was “driving the wheels off” and he had a 2004 mustang that he bought in 2006 for the price of a new mustang (long story). Soon into our marriage my beater blew up. Then we were both using the ‘stang and paying 160/wk in gas plus ins 100/mth plus 460/mth payment.1200 a month going to that stupid car. So my husband traded that car for a 2007 Focus (paid 24000 cuz of the debt on the stanky ‘stang. Dealerships really see him coming, don’t they?)  Since then we’ve went from a family of 2 to a family of 5 (triplets) soon to be a family of 6. Now I’ve got involved in the car buying process. He wants to trade our 07 Focus that we still owe 14,000 on for a bigger car. I want to buy a used car. The one I have in mind currently is a 04 chevy astro with 300000 miles. They want 1800 for it. The third option is to buy a car possibly with less miles but we only have 1800.

How about cost of continued maintenance?  In today’s used car market, the landscape is littered with failed brands (in the US alone, think Mercury, Saturn, Hummer, Pontiac, Plymouth, and a few others).  How hard will it be to get parts going forward?\n\n3) The cost of safety – is very hard to calculate.  If I own a 1985 Toyota Corolla without airbags, and buy a 2005 Toyota Corolla with air bags – can you put a value on the price of safety?\n\nI am all for keeping cars a long time.  I do the same myself  I own a 2003 Honda Accord with 115,000 and fortuntely, because I bought the extended warranty, can still afford to keep the car (two failed transmissions at 30,000 and 90,000 were covered fully by Honda).  The next failure and it will be time for the graveyard – hopefully it waits until 150,000 at least before failing.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMike Fischer says\n\t\t\t\t11 September 2012 at 09:15\n\nThere are no hard and fast rules as to when you should really sell your car. Look out for signs, such as higher and higher maintenance troubles, lowering performance and so on and you will know when you should say goodbye to your car.\n\nTwitter: @unocardealers\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSimon says\n\t\t\t\t14 July 2013 at 00:40\n\nI never quite understand the logic that says if repairs cost less than loan repayment, then keep your own clunker and save money.\n\nBut if I have to pay $3000/Â£3000 to maintain a vehicle over three years that I know Im going to have to get rid of, well, that’s $3000/Â£3000 I could have used towards a newer car.\n\nAnd why do all these guides keep comparing keeping an old car vs buying a brand new car? What about just a newer used car? \n\nI was doing my own maths. And I can figure a Car loan could cost Â£2500 to pay back per year, but I could save Â£800 a year on fuel, insurance and tax. The net cost is therefore Â£1700. Over four years ownership, this will be Â£6800. Residual sale value after this period would be Â£4500, so then I’ve actually really only spent Â£2300 on a new car over four years – ie, Â£600 a month.\n\nIt becomes more appealing to me when I factor in the repairs I would have to do to my current car. If I have to spent Â£1000 on my current car to keep it going, well, instead of throwing that into the pit, I might get lucky and not have to do anything on the newer vehicle so then we can write hat value off against the cost – Â£2300 – Â£1000 = Â£1300…. Or at worst we will have to do some maintenance to the current vehicle too. But at least the newer vehicle still retains its residual value and has some worth – unlike the clunker.\n\nThe two compelling arguments against a newer car are a) finances and never being certain  of the future and b) you can trust your old car quite a bit and doesn’t matter if it does blow up to a certain extent. It’s been reliable up to now and with appropriate care will continue to be reliable. Newer cars are a bit hit a miss.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tChris Williams says\n\t\t\t\t28 September 2013 at 11:07\n\nHaha this is awesome. I love hearing stories like this.

Current issue is radio, can’t get replacement one and really want one, even without cassette player.\n\nBut this article, and the comments, don’t address the debate for someone who would pay CASH (I would) rather than finance the car. Given savings aren’t earning much now, it’s less of a dilemma than it might have been years ago. Car still runs, car is safe (I guess), but its gas mileage could be better and newer car (not new car) would have working stereo and curtain air bags. Still, I keep it. If there were another car I were in love with, I might make the leap (mistake), but I would never buy new. Only issue is sort of wobbly steering, and not easy for my young son to practice on (student driver) but he is fine with taking bus, he doesn’t care about getting a license and he is 21 now.\n\nThanks for the nice piece.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTekni says\n\t\t\t\t19 January 2014 at 17:48\n\nThis all seems nonsense to me.\n\nMy accountant says if you keep your car more than 2 years you start to eat too deeply into the price difference for a new one. So we have always looked for the late autumn sales and changed cars every other year. Last year we traded our 2yr old Honda Odyssey (bought originally new at $7,000 off retail)in for a Toyota Venza (selling brand new for $4,000 off retail)for only $2,000 cash difference. Plus we get a brand new car and always get to enjoy the latest technology as well as a permanent warranty and free breakdown tow and repair. Whole package is worth every penny of $2,000 surely?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\twilliam says\n\t\t\t\t30 October 2015 at 15:44\n\nIMHO, thats the way to go! I’m with your thinking 100%.\n\nSaving pennies, or a couple bucks each month just seems pointless to me, I would way rather have a car I can rely on, and take the family on a little road trip whenever we feel like it. Gee let’s take a road trip to Tahoe this weekend, sorry honey we can’t were saving $8.75 this month driving our car that won’t make it out of the county…I’ll never understand that logic???\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJackson says\n\t\t\t\t04 December 2015 at 14:08\n\nThat is nice thinking, only if you have cash every 2yrs when buying a car.

Always reliable. I’ve always done regular maintenance and the vehicle has returned the favor with reliability. Unfortunately rust has appeared over the past few years, and a recent windshield replacement uncovered rust around the entire mount section. A specialist gave an estimate of $1500 to repair the entire section, paint the roof (part of the repair), and replace the rusted back bumper. Call me crazy, but I am going to do it. Other maintenance is infrequent, and averages about $750/year. This Toytota 4Runner has been the most reliable thing I’ve owned – and I am going to drive it until the end of days.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLinda J. says\n\t\t\t\t22 March 2015 at 12:18\n\nIt made better sense for me to purchase a used reliable car(Honda Accord) than to keep anticipating the next headache repair job on a 2006 Taurus with 92,000 miles on it and had water leaking in to the front passenger floor.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAaron says\n\t\t\t\t31 October 2015 at 02:02\n\nMy wife and I have 3 vehicles right now.

I work 1 mile from home and she works maybe 4 miles from home. The accord has 196k miles and the rogue has 38k. Should I sell the rogue while it has some value to it since we work so close to home or should I sell the Honda and drive the more up to date car? Reminder, they are both paid off. I’m just trying to figure out what’s smarter.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tOldCarsAreStillGoodCars says\n\t\t\t\t10 February 2016 at 08:59\n\nWe have a rule to try and drive the cars 20 years, at around 15 years we start a savings plan to get a new car, when the car reaches 20 years we know that we can drive it until the wheels fall off, and have it towed to the junk yard. My “new” car is now 10 years old, and our old car is 21 years old. Completely reliable. The key for us is to really maintain it, and occasionally refresh it so it feels like new again. Every 5 years I take it to have all the little dings taken out.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCharles says\n\t\t\t\t02 June 2016 at 09:34\n\nThis article motivated me to get the car.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTechLifeGeek says\n\t\t\t\t05 September 2016 at 04:48\n\nMy car is almost 10 years old and achieved more than 123,000 KMs.  Achieving this many kilometers in a traffic ridden Metro Manila is quite an achievement.  I think the meticulous maintenance has paid off. I’ve made sure that it gets regular maintenance and when there’s something weird – weird noise or feeling, I get it checked out right away.\n\nOther important factors that made it last this long are having a good honest mechanic and a good source of auto parts (my car is a Honda).    My goal has been to achieve at least 10 years and 120,000 KMs at the minimum to get the most value out of the car. But since it is still running well, I am planning to keep it for another 3 years. I drive the car a lot on highways so safety is a priority. If before the 3 years, it becomes unsafe, I would then replace it with a new one and drive it to the ground.  I personally do not prefer to buy used because of the unknown history the car may have. BTW, I drive a Honda Fit (called Honda Jazz in the Philippines) and it’s still achieving 14kms/liter in city driving. And this hatchback has been very functional! I most probably get another Honda Fit after this one.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tKatie Ryan O'Connor says\n\t\t\t\t06 September 2016 at 10:17\n\nAmazing!

I love cars but would rather be debt free. I feel proud driving one of the older cars on the road, but is still safe and has very good safety features, 03 ford focus. I love it and will keep it till it dies. I don’t see the point in paying half a year’s wages for a car.

It’s served us well, racking up just under 100K miles so far, relatively trouble free.\n\nWe’ll run it until the maintenance costs are about half what we’d finance a new car for, and then buy a new vehicle.  (By that time, though, we’ll have a *large* down payment.)\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tmeeuns says\n\t\t\t\t12 October 2016 at 16:18\n\nThis contribution simply ignores one of the most important and costly aspects of owing a new car–automotive insurance. Full collision insurance on these new cars–almost always required because they are bank-financed, and certainly always desired even when the vehicle gets paid for by the buyer in full at purchase–will typically run in the thousands per year. And that is money you will never recoup, except in the case of the very rare event of a serious accident. Over a lifetime of automobile ownership you will have been able, had you been buying used cars and covering them with only liability insurance, to purchase several new vehicles, or a fleet of used ones, outright, with the savings on insurance costs. Under almost no normal-life scenario is it more cost-effective to buy new cars than used, when you factor in the associated insurance costs.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\nLeave a reply\n\n\t\t\t\tClick here to cancel reply.\t\t\t\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Roth\n\n|\n\nPublished: 15 January 2018 – Updated: 13 October 2024\n\n|\n\n348 comments\n\n\t63\n\tshares\n\n\t52\n\n\t2\n\n\t9\n\nAs part of back to basics month, let’s use today to explore how you can get out of debt without gimmicks or games.\n\nAfter twelve years of reading and writing about money, I’ve come to believe that debt reduction ought to be a side effect and not a goal. Getting out of debt is a target, not a habit. And, as we’ve been discussing recently, good goals are built around actions instead of numbers. If you restructure your life so that you’re spending less than you earn, you will get out of debt. It’s a natural side effect.\n\nHaving said that, I realize that a lot of GRS readers are struggling to get to square one. Getting out of debt is their goal and primary obsession. That’s okay.\n\nBefore you can begin repaying your debt, you must be earning a profit. Unless your income exceeds your expenses, your debt is actually increasing. If you’re continuing to add debt, or if you’re only able to make minimum payments, you must first find ways to spend less and earn more until you have a positive “saving rate”. (Both businesses and people earn profits. But when individuals earn a personal profit, we call it “savings”.)\n\nAfter you’re earning a personal profit, you can (and should) make debt elimination a priority.\n\nWhy You Should Pay Off Your Debt\n\nDebt repayment can improve your credit score, meaning you’ll pay less on everything from rent to car insurance to future borrowing needs. Plus, debt reduction is one of the best returns you can earn on your money.\n\nInvesting in the stock market provides an average annual return of about 10% — but that return isn’t guaranteed. Some years the market is up 30%, but other years it drops by 40%. When you pay down a credit card, you earn a guaranteed return of 20% (or whatever your interest rate is). That’s tough to beat.\n\nThere are also non-financial benefits to paying off debt, including:\n\nSimplicity. The more debt you have, the more bills you have. It’s easier to manage your money when you have a simple, efficient financial infrastructure. Each time you pay off a debt, you move one step closer to this ideal.\n\nCash flow. Whenever you eliminate a debt, the money formerly used for that monthly payment becomes available to pursue other goals – including fun stuff like ski trips and knitting supplies.\n\nFreedom. When you have monthly payments to meet, you’re chained to your job. You’re unable to take risks. Once your debt is gone, a wider range of options becomes available to you.\n\nPeace of mind. Best of all, once you’re debt-free, you can sleep easier at night. You’ll put less pressure on yourself, and you’ll have fewer fights about money with your partner.\n\nWhen I first tried to get out of debt, I lacked a system. Without a plan, I sent extra money to one credit card and then another. As a result, I never seemed to make any progress.\n\nAfter deciding to become boss of my own life, however, I researched how to get out of debt. Many books recommended a strategy called the “debt snowball”. Although I was skeptical, I gave it a try. The method worked. Using it, I managed to eliminate my debt and begin saving for the future.\n\nStop Acquiring New Debt\n\nThis may seem self-evident, but the reason your debt is out of control is that you keep adding to it. Stop using credit. Don’t finance anything. Cut up your credit cards.\n\nThat last one can be tough. Don’t make excuses. I don’t care that other personal finance sites say that you shouldn’t cut them up. Destroy them. Stop rationalizing that you need them.\n\nYou don’t need credit cards for a safety net.\n\nYou don’t need credit cards for convenience.\n\nYou don’t need credit cards for cash-back bonuses.\n\nYou don’t need credit cards at all. If you’re in debt, credit cards are a trap. They only put you deeper in debt. Later, when your debts are gone and your finances are under control, maybe then you can get a credit card. (I don’t carry a personal credit card. I don’t miss having one.)\n\nAfter you destroy your cards, halt any recurring payments. If you have a gym membership, cancel it. If you automatically renew your World of Warcraft account, cancel it. Cancel anything that automatically charges your credit card. Stop using credit.\n\nOnce you’ve done this, call each credit card company in turn. Do not cancel your credit cards (except for those with a zero balance). Instead, ask for a better deal. Find a low interest credit offer online and use it as a bargaining wedge. Your bank may not agree to match competing offers, but it probably will. It never hurts to ask.\n\nEstablish an Emergency Fund\n\nFor some, this is counter-intuitive. Why save for an emergency fund before paying off debt? Because if you don’t save first, you’re not going to be able to cope with unexpected expenses. Do not tell yourself that you can keep a credit card for emergencies. Destroy your credit cards; save cash for emergencies.\n\nHow much should you save? Ideally, you’d save $1,000 to start. (College students may be able to get by with $500.) This money is for emergencies only. It is not for beer. It is not for shoes. It is not for the latest Playstation. It is to be used when your car dies, or when you break your arm in a touch football game.\n\nKeep this money liquid, but not immediately accessible. Don’t tie your emergency fund to a debit card. Don’t sabotage your efforts by making it easy to spend the money on non-essentials. Consider opening an online savings account. When an emergency arises, you can easily transfer the money to your regular checking account. It’ll be there when you need it, but you won’t be able to spend it spontaneously.\n\nThe Debt Snowball\n\nWith the debt snowball, you set aside a specific amount of cash each month to pay off the money you owe. At first, progress is slow. In time, however, you begin to make rapid progress, picking up speed like a snowball rolling downhill.\n\nStep One\n\nThe first step is to make a list of your debts. For each obligation, include the balance you owe, the interest rate, and the minimum payment. Arrange the list so that the debt with the highest interest rate is on top. Next comes the debt with the second-highest interest rate, and so on, until you reach the final debt on the list, which will be the one with the lowest interest rate.\n\nFor instance, here’s the actual list of my debts from October 2004, ordered by interest rate:\n\nComputer Loan: $1116 @ 15% ($48 min)\n\nBusiness Loan $2800 @ 11% ($30 min)\n\nHome Equity Loan $21000 @ 6% ($100 min)\n\nCar Loan $2250 @ 5% ($170 min)\n\nPersonal Loan $1600 @ 3% ($100 min)\n\nPersonal Loan $6430 @ 0% ($60 min)\n\nI had $35,196 in debt and my minimum payments totaled $508 per month.\n\nStep Two\n\nOnce you’ve listed your debts, decide how much you can afford to pay toward them each month in total. This should be at least the total of your minimum payments ($508 in the example above), and preferably more. In my case, I started by allocating $700 every month toward debt reduction.\n\nStep Three\n\nNow, for all of your debts except the debt with the highest interest rate, make minimum payments every month. Use the rest of the money you’ve allocated for debt reduction to pay down the debt with the highest interest rate.\n\nThe computer loan topped my list of debts with an interest rate of 15%. The minimum payments for the other debts combined to $460 per month. Under this plan, I’d then take the remainder of the $700 I’d allocated toward monthly debt reduction and apply it to the computer loan. Instead of making the $48 minimum payment, I’d pay $240.\n\nStep Four\n\nRepeat this process every month until the debt at the top of the list has been eliminated.\n\nStep Five\n\nHere’s where this method gets powerful. With your first debt defeated, you don’t use your improved cash flow to buy new things. Instead, you use the extra cash to attack the next debt on your list.\n\nIf I start by applying $700 toward debt each month, for example, I continue to apply $700 toward debt each month until all of the debt is gone. After the computer loan is retired, I focus on the business loan. Because the minimum payment on my other debts would be $430, I could funnel $270 to pay off the business debt every month.\n\nWhen the business debt is gone, I’d then throw $370 per month at the home equity loan, and so on. Ultimately, I’d be left with a single loan: the $6430 personal loan at 0% interest. Every month, I’d apply all $700 to get rid of this debt.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nThe debt snowball is powerful and effective. Mathematically, it’s the best way to get rid of your debt. There’s just one problem.\n\nWhen you attack your debts from highest interest rate to lowest, you’ll pay less money in the long run. Unfortunately, many folks – including me – find the going difficult. In my case, I hit a wall when I reached the third debt on the list, my home equity loan. That $21,000 balance was going to take years to repay. I didn’t have that kind of patience.\n\nFortunately, I learned there were other ways to order your debts. You don’t have to tackle the high interest rates first.\n\nBuilding a Better Snowball\n\nHumans are complex psychological creatures. They’re not adding machines. Many of us know what we ought to do but find it difficult to actually make the best choices. (If we were adding machines, we wouldn’t accumulate consumer debt in the first place!) It’s misguided to tell somebody so deep in debt that they must follow the repayment plan that minimizes interest payments. The important thing to do is to set up a system of positive reinforcement.\n\nBecause of this, many people prefer slight variations on the debt snowball method. These methods ignore math in favor of psychology.\n\nDave Ramsey’s Debt Snowball\n\nFinancial guru Dave Ramsey has popularized one variation of the debt snowball. Instead of ordering your debts by interest rate, he suggests you attack those with the lowest balances first.\n\nUsing Ramsey’s method, my debts from 2004 would be ordered like this:\n\nComputer Loan: $1116 @ 15% ($48 min)\n\nPersonal Loan $1600 @ 3% ($100 min)\n\nCar Loan $2250 @ 5% ($170 min)\n\nBusiness Loan $2800 @ 11% ($30 min)\n\nPersonal Loan $6430 @ 0% ($60 min)\n\nHome Equity Loan $21000 @ 6% ($100 min)\n\nAs with the standard debt snowball method, I’d make minimum payments on each debt except the top one on the list. At it, I’d throw everything else I’ve allocated for debt reduction each month. When the top debt was eliminated, I’d move on to the one with the next smallest balance.\n\nRamsey’s variation isn’t as quick as paying high-interest debt first, and in the long-run, you’ll lose slightly more to interest payments. (In my own case, the projections showed it’d take an extra month to repay my debt and I’d pay and extra $841.15 in interest.) However, there’s a psychological advantage to doing things this way.\n\nBy attacking your smallest debts first, you get some quick wins, which provide a mental boost. This psychological lift provides extra motivation to keep attacking that debt. Every few months, you get the satisfaction of crossing another debt off the list! Ramsey says this is “behavior modification over math”, and he’s right. In fact, I opted to use this variation of the debt snowball when I repaid my own $35,000 of debt in 39 months.\n\nAdam Baker’s Debt Tsunami\n\nOther experts, including my buddy Adam Baker from Man vs. Debt, suggest yet a third alternative they call the debt tsunami. They argue it’s best to pay off your debts in order of their emotional impact. Attack your debts from smallest balance to highest, they say, but for added psychological boost, prioritize any debt that particularly bugs you.\n\n“I used to be addicted to gambling,” Baker says, “and I had debt that was specifically associated with gambling. To pay that off first changed me as a person. To pay off the $600 I owed on a credit card was great, but it didn’t change me. It didn’t signify that my life was going to be different and that I was going to live in a different way.”\n\nBut paying off his gambling debt did mean something to him, so Baker attacked that first.\n\nHere’s another example: Many people borrow money from their parents. These loans may carry interest rates of only two or three percent (or maybe they’re interest free), but they come with a lot of psychological baggage. This is another instance where it might make sense to pay down low-interest debt first because the non-financial rewards are so great.\n\nThe most important thing when paying off your debts is to pay off your debts; the order in which you do so is ultimately irrelevant. Find a system that works for you and develop the discipline to stick with it.\n\nNote: It’s less imperative to repay low-interest debt. Businesses use “leverage” to borrow money cheaply so that they can earn higher returns elsewhere. You do the same when taking out a mortgage at low rate (like three percent) or using school loans to improve your education (which will, in theory, provide high future returns). It’s good to repay all of your debt, of course, but it’s okay to make repaying the mortgage a long-term goal instead of lumping it in with your debt snowball.\n\nSupplementary Solutions\n\nYou can do other things to improve your money situation while you’re working on these three steps.\n\nFirst, focus on the fundamental personal finance equation: to pay off debt, or to save money, or to accumulate wealth, you must spend less than you earn.\n\nCurb your spending. Re-learn frugal habits. (Frugality is something with which most college students are all too familiar.) You can find some great ideas in the archives of this site. Also check Frugal for Life.\n\nWhile you work to spend less, do what you can to increase your income. If possible, sell some of the stuff you bought when you got into debt. Get an extra job. (But don’t neglect your studies for the sake of earning more. Your studies are most important.)\n\nFinally, go to your local public library and borrow Dave Ramsey’s The Total Money Makeover. Don’t be put off by the title — this is a fantastic guide to getting out of debt and developing good money habits. I rave about it often, but that’s because it has done so much to help my own personal finances. After you’ve finished, return it and borrow another book about money.\n\nSimple, Not Easy\n\nHuman beings are complex creatures. Some of us are highly logical. Some of us are emotional. Most of us fall someplace in between. We rarely make decisions based on optimal paths; more often, we choose what makes us happy in the short term. I’m not saying that this is the right thing to do — it’s just what happens. For those who routinely make financial decisions based on emotion, it can be difficult to turn things around.\n\nComplaining that personal finance is easy and “why doesn’t everyone do what they ought” is like saying that running a marathon is easy so why can’t everybody run one? Most of us understand how to prepare for a marathon — eat right and run a hell of a lot — but few of us have the dedication and mental fortitude to complete one. However, with a little discipline and some hard work, most people can complete a 10k race.\n\nIt’s the same with personal finance. It’s easy to say, “To build wealth, you must spend less than you earn”, but it’s another thing to do it, especially over the long term. In some ways, building wealth is more difficult than running a marathon. Training for and completing a marathon takes months. Dedicating yourself to a sensible financial plan is a lifetime process.\n\nIf personal finance were really as simple as understanding the math, we would all be rich. But it’s not. And we’re not. That’s why I think any small financial victory is important. That’s why I run this website, and why I share whatever tips I can find.\n\nI always say “do what works for you”“. Some people are able to succeed by paying high-interest debt first. But some people — myself included — have only been able to succeed by trying another approach. The approach may not be best from a mathematical viewpoint, but I believe that any method that actually helps you meet your goals is better than one that doesn’t.\n\nPersonal finance concepts might be simple, but that doesn’t mean they’re easy. I don’t mean to imply that they are. It took a lot of hard work (and a little luck) for me to get out of debt. It didn’t happen quickly, and it wasn’t easy.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs I mentioned at the start, I’ve come to believe that debt repayment is a side effect and not a goal. You shouldn’t make it your primary purpose.\n\nIf you do the other things I recommend, such as creating a personal mission statement and boosting your profit margin, you’ll naturally pay off debt as a matter of course. But you’ll enjoy a benefit many people don’t have once their debts are gone.\n\nYou see, a lot of people feel lost once they’ve dug out of debt. Search online and you’ll find tons of questions and conversations about what to do next. Debt repayment had given them purpose, and now that purpose is gone. As a result, they lose financial direction. And like a dieter who had aimed for a weight instead of a lifestyle change, an unfortunate few of the newly debt-free find themselves resuming bad habits.\n\nIf you’re pursuing other goals and intentionally building good habits, you’ll get out of debt. And once you get out of debt, the good times will continue: That debt snowball you’ve been building will transform itself into a wealth snowball.\n\nCongratulations! You’re on your way to financial freedom!\n\nHave you ever had to dig out of debt? What methods did you use? Were some more successful than others? If you had to do it over again, would you have done anything differently?

Debt is not necessarily inherently toxic, as you can invest in products with better interest than some debts have. If you’ve got a terrible deal on a big debt, though, you should pay that off fast imho, not take out smaller debts first.\n\nEDIT: Oops, this wasn’t supposed to be a reply.

I don’t recommend cutting up credit cards, I only found this site after getting out of credit card debt. I recommend finding the highest positive ratio of debt and attacking it first: Take the total debt and divide it by the minimum payment for all debt, the highest number is the debt to pay off first and yields the most benefit. It will give the quickest payoff with more minimum payments going to other debt sooner.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDoe rae me says\n\t\t\t\t20 February 2014 at 12:14\n\nMy bad, it’s been a while. The above method would give the LOWEST number to attack first. Example: 2 credit cards, one with 400 balance and 15 minimum payment and one with 500 balance and 25 minimum payment. If you have 100 extra to attack debt, paying off the 400 credit card first then the 500 would take 8.34 months (without interest/finance charges). Attacking the LOWEST ratio (the 500 first then the 400) would take 8.2 months (without interest). Having the extra 25 to apply to other debt works faster. It also curves the temptation to use that credit card, knowing that the minimum payment will hurt you more.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWilliam Mize says\n\t\t\t\t16 November 2006 at 06:44\n\nI’d like to elaborate on the “Sell Some of Your Stuff” advice – I’ve had really good luck selling used books and CD’s on amazon.com.

The reasons why this is a good idea for me are:\n\n1. it’s free. I don’t pay any interest because I pay it off in full every month. In fact I actually maintain a small credit balance most of the time so they actually pay me a few cents interest every month. And you thought irony was something that happened to other people.\n\n2. it’s free. I don’t pay a monthly fee for transactions. The debit card I get from my bank has a limit of 30 transactions per month, past that they charge 50c a transaction. This all adds up! I pay a yearly fee for the card but it works out to about $1.50. Compared to the debit card I think I’m ahead.\n\n3. They pay me! We don’t actually have reward cards and cash back cards in New Zealand, but we do get points that you can use to buy stuff with. When you use the card for absolutely everything, they add up.\n\n4. I have a really low limit. I have a $500 limit on my card, even if I wanted to , I couldn’t get into trouble with this card. Whenever I hear about people with ‘000s of dollars on their cards, I just boggle.\n\nI’m not saying this is the best idea for everyone, especially if you are trying to recover from debt, but once you have credit cards can be useful. You have to keep control of them.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSteven Williams says\n\t\t\t\t03 May 2011 at 05:13\n\nShop around for other offers from other banks.  My debit card has a $10,000 daily limit.  \n\nIt also had a very good rewards program that they just canceled because the businesses owners got upset with higher merchant account fees to pay the rewards.\n\nCredit card companies have good reward card programs because they charge you interest on the charges you make.  In essence they are paying you with your own money.\n\nI’m not totally against credit cards but I just don’t have them anymore personally.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJoe 6 says\n\t\t\t\t03 January 2012 at 13:55\n\nWhile you’re right that it is free to you since you pay off the balance each month, please realize you are still feeding the system.  The banks make money by charging the merchant 2 to 5% as a fee when you swipe your card.  This is money draining out of your local community and going into the coffers of the big banks.  Keep the money local: use cash!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tdate eater says\n\t\t\t\t28 December 2012 at 23:55\n\nThe stores accept cards despite the fees because they will make more in sales.  People are more likely to buy more if the store takes cards.  If everyone paid in cash, the stores wouldn’t be earning as much.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tStudent Loan Consolidation Advice says\n\t\t\t\t16 November 2006 at 13:56\n\nYou could consolidate your loans – http://www.StudentLoanConsolidator.com offers both federal and private student loan consolidation.

Interestingly enough, I am already applying this method to my own debt.\n\nI left work a few years ago to go back to school so I could get into a job I really wanted. Unfortunately, that meant being very dumb and living off credit cards. I would not have needed to do this, but I was accustomed to a particular lifestyle that I did not modify for being unemployed, retarded I know. Let’s just say i wasn’t an econ major. 😉\n\nAnyways, so here I am years later, and I have lots of high-interest, five-figure debt. Yay me! I knew it was time to put my education on hold and go back to work. So I have been limiting my expenditures, paying off debt as outlined here and I just started a savings account.\n\nWhat I basically do is take 10% of my wifes check, and mine, and xfer that to a savings account, no questions asked; it’s as if it doesn’t exist. And, at the end of each week, I go through my online bank statement and look at what frivolous things I spent money on (video game, pub, dining out, etc), and I take 10% of that amount and place it into my savings.\n\nThis has worked really well for me. I do need to work on curbing my spending even more to be truly lean, but these changes have truly made all the difference.\n\nPlease get rid of you CC debt and NEVER, EVER, get debt again with a CC. They are scum taking advantage of people. If you need to put it on a CC, you don’t NEED it.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSue J says\n\t\t\t\t08 July 2012 at 20:04\n\nPlease – do not say “retarded”.

And for those that are unclear on the Debt Snowball, it is a great idea that totally makes sense once you put it into action.\n\nExample:\n\nYou have 3 CC. a) $2000/$100mo, b) $2500/$120 c) $5000/$200.\n\nPick a budget, an aggressive one, let’s say, $600 a month to pay towards CC debt. This is the MINIMUM you pay. Pay more when you can. And pick a card to focus on, we’ll choose card a.\n\nSo, out of that $600, pay the minimum on cards b and c, and pay the remainder on card a. So, b gets $120, c gets $200. That leaves $280 for card a. Keep paying card a until it’s done. This is the beginning of the snowball.\n\nThen choose the next card to pay off, we’ll choose b. Add the $280 to the minimum you were paying for card b, that’s $380 you are paying to card b. You’ll pay it off ever faster than card a! Pay that off.\n\nThen, finish the giant snowball, and put all $600 towards the last card. Voila! This method really does work.\n\nI wold also add that while you are doing this, look for good deals on a new CC. One thing I did was when I paid off a card, I decided to use the CC to help instead of hurt me. I told them I wanted to cancel my card, but what I really wanted to do was manipulate them into wanting to keep me as a customer. So I told them I would keep their card if they lowered their APR AND transfer the balance of one of my higher interest cards. Boom! I just saved myself a lot of money and I was still able to close down a CC account.\n\nAnyways, good luck guys!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSam says\n\t\t\t\t28 July 2013 at 18:54\n\nGood advice especially if card A is the one with the highest interest rate of your 3 cards, and you do not use card A while paying it down.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tChris Thomas says\n\t\t\t\t20 November 2006 at 13:40\n\nDave would be proud.

For example, if your CC information is stolen, your CC company cannot hold you responsible for any unauthorized charges. However, if your debit card info is stolen, along with your PIN, you may be out of luck. At best, you’ll get your money back eventually (after a long waiting period), and at worst, you’ll be liable for everything.\n\nhttp://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeting/article/102730/credit-cards-offer-better-protections-than-debit-cards\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMichael says\n\t\t\t\t17 April 2007 at 08:49\n\nThe “snowball” does not recognize math should play into the equation.  I have managed to get most of my debt down to 5% or less, but there are two cards with higher rates that won’t go lower.  I am paying higher% before lower%.\n\nI understand that sometimes the psychology of paying a CC off in full is important, but not always.  People need to start looking at the total INTEREST charges of all their debt each month, adding it up, and setting fire to a pile of $1 bill (fakes) to represent that money.\n\nIt hurts!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tdate eater says\n\t\t\t\t29 December 2012 at 00:07\n\nI agree, except that I really value cash flow.  It’s important to free up more dollars sooner.  So I will consider/weigh paying off something with a lower rate in order to free up more $ sooner that can go to paying the next item down.\n\nIf I were to set up my snowball to pay off highest rate balances first, it would tie up my cash flow longer.  If my highest interest rate item is also the biggest balance, I would be making minimum payments on everything for a long time.\n\nBut if I can get some cash flow free right away, it gives me more options.  For instance, a great investment opportunity could come along.  I could put debt paydown on hold and use the free cash for the investment.  \n\nSo when you consider “real options”, paying off small balances can be mathematically sound.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tStacy says\n\t\t\t\t29 April 2007 at 17:46\n\nOkay I have a mess…..$21,000 in credit card debt, a home that where are buying $69,000, and a new car $10,000.00.

If you have children, increasing work hours may require increased day care costs. Avoid creating that new expense by working opposite shifts or adding work during school hours only. You will have to give up your life for a while and only focus on debt payoff – it won’t be fun, but it will be worth it.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLiz says\n\t\t\t\t02 May 2007 at 20:57\n\nI found this site while looking for sites on getting out of debt, and it has been wonderful and helpful. I never thought of the idea of snowballing (?) my payments before, and just started on that recently. I have to say it is almost fun to see the balances on something reduce themselves even a tiny bit –\n\n I have a whopping amount of personal debt from being a student, and also being depressed for about four years.. it amassed quickly.

Many people would not be able to drive a car or live in a house if they did not incur a debt to purchase it.\n\nI agree that many people cannot manage debt well, just like many people cannot manage a diet well with chocolate cake in the house 🙂\n\nYou don’t blame the cake for the diet problems and you don’t blame credit for credit problems.  However, if you are too tempted to not stick to “the rules”, then manybe eliminating the problem from your life works for you.  If so, I applaud your ability to never use credit.\n\nJust remember one thing:  Well used credit can actually INCREASE your cash flow.  How?  My spouse needed a laptop so that she could work on her online college degree without others interrupting her on our only PC.  I found a deal with Dell on a very good, very fast laptop that was interest free for 18 months.  I have 4 more payments to make and paid no interest.  This means, my savings is still making interest and I paid nothing else for the laptop.\n\nAs long as you find intellegent ways to use “other people’s money”, you can still use credit and not pay for it.\n\nOnce again, JD, another good article.

So for every 45 I put on, my bill only went down 7.\n\nI’ve found the easiest way to judge which cc to pay off first is whichever one has the smallest difference between the monthly finance charge and the minimum payment amount.  The greater that difference, the more your payment is actually paying down debt.  The smaller that difference is, the more you’re just paying interest and will never pay it off.  Throw huge chunks of money at those cards immediately!!!  You’ll have a better percentage of your money actually paying off debt instead of interest.  If you ever pay near the minimum on a high apr card, you’re wasting money right then and there and also, more of the high debt is sitting longer gathering more interest. \n\nOnce you get the cards managed better, DON’T CLOSE THE ACCOUNT!!! Even if at zero, keep it open, even if you have to hide the card in old luggage or cut it up or something.  The reason is that the percentage of available credit you have in combo with how long you’ve had the credit card open helps tremendously with your credit score and ability to get an important loan like a house.  You should have a low percentage of unpaid debt vs credit availability.  If you owe $500 left but have $10,000 available credit (credit card limits), that’ll give you a much better score than if you close one of those paid off cards and only have $5000 available credit.  And try to stay below 1/3 credit used on any one card.  The closer you are to the max on a card, the riskier it looks to the credit reporting agencies.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tST says\n\t\t\t\t02 June 2007 at 10:10\n\nSeems that this post is about putting “overcoming your faults” over good financial sense.  If you cannot equate credit cards with cash, that’s your problem.\n\nIf you think the advice here is good financially, it seems that you should go into therapy instead.  Go into *more* debt in order to figure out how to live within your means by dealing with what’s making you act irrationally.  A good friend of mine did that: therapy, then got a new job, then went to the bank and got a 6% loan to cover all her debts and paid off all her credit cards, starting with the highest interest (like any one with sense would do).\n\nIf, on the other hand, you’re in debt because of extenuating circumstances or college is just too darn expensive, then do what all the books say.  Make a budget, consolidate debt, use 0% offers, use the one credit card with a 0 balance as it is cheaper than cash.  You’ll get out of debt years faster than with this tripe.  Come on, that bit about the “lowest balance,” is just inane.  Why not do a balance transfer?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBarbara Saunders says\n\t\t\t\t07 June 2007 at 14:00\n\nI find it fascinating that most “get out of debt” advice pieces skip the obvious. Some people simply need to make more money. I had some very bad credit problems years ago and did some soul-searching. I was spending beyond my means, yes, but I was also underearning at a level that was ridiculous. That is, spending within my means at the time would not have afforded me a decent place to live and groceries. I was paying dentist bills and replacing holey underwear with borrowed money.\n\nThis is a self-esteem issue. I’m in a job now that I enjoy and took for a relatively low salary. An honest look at my future prospects has me looking for a position with a salary appropriate for my experience level. When I see coworkers their forties in my low-paying workplace going without cars and choosing which bills to pay each month, I am reminded that “being frugal” and the notion “living within one’s means” can veer into self-destructiveness.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tHannes says\n\t\t\t\t15 June 2007 at 01:23\n\nAgain, a fantastic article.

I had no one to cosign, so without credit, I would have been screwed.

You do need the ability to borrow. However, they are not looking at the real problem with our economy and the debt burdens that people have been subjected to. Credit Card companies like to lure you in with small opening balances and as time passes and you make payments they increase those limits sometimes to unbelievable sizes. For instance I have a $25000 credit limit on a card.I also have 21900 on that card charged. I have another card that has a $4000 limit and I happened to exceed that limit so not only did they charge me $39 over the limit fee but also raised my 4.99% to a whopping 30%. Needless to say I paid the entire card off and cut it up. Most people cannot afford to do that. I couldn’t either except my tax refund came at the right time. My other cards are 0% and 9.9%. This debt also causes alot of other things to happen. The deflation of the dollar, the mortgage-crisis, the rise in oil prices, and commodity prices. They are all interconnected. The main point here is that before the late 60’s – early 70’s when credit cards first came about people saved and bought what they needed and could afford with cash (except assets like a home or necessity such as a car). Our grandparents would roll in their grave to know that we are paying interest on groceries, eating-out, gas,and entertainment -all things that hold no value. So when debt reaches a point beyond the limit of comfort, you essentially become an endentured servant to society and life becomes stressful and unfullfilling. It’s like one of my favorite sayings, “If you put a frog in hot water he’ll jump out. If you put a frog in cold water and slowly turn up the heat, he’ll boil to death”. That is what alot of us are suffering from. So do not knock those in debt trying to turn things around. At least they are not filling bankrupcy.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tKathyJ says\n\t\t\t\t13 April 2008 at 08:43\n\nTest.

The moral of the story is things happen and if you pay cash, you will never be stuck paying interest on cash payments. \n\nCredit cards is not a necessity–it’s a credit score buster!!

We have already completed steps 1 and 2 (stopped acquiring new debt and cut up all 12 credit cards, as well as established an emergency fund) and we are currently attacking the cards.  \n\nFirst I needed to go back through our bank records to see exactly where our money was going.  I went back 6 months and was shocked at what I learned!  My husband is self-employed, and I had a vague idea what he was spending his money on, but I didn’t know EXACTLY where his money was going (or how much).  Once I analyzed how much he was spending on what, I was able to put him on a budget.  We have been married almost 11 years and we have never had a “household budget.”  Ever.  But now I know how so very important this step is!  Since we now keep track of every single penny that enters and leaves our lives, we are no longer spending  money haphazardly.  I have started making him take a lunch from home every day, which saves a ton of money on fast food.  Instead of using a debit card to buy groceries, we take a designated amout of cash with us to the store and ONLY spend that.  I’ve increased my hours at work (now that the morning sickness is gone), and we are trying very hard to live more frugally in general (shutting off lights that used to stay on, shutting down the computer nightly instead of leaving it on for days… things like that).\n\nAnd guess what?  We have been able to pay off 3 of our lowest balance credit cards in only a month!  (Only 9 cards to go!)  Before we took a good, hard look at how stupidly we were handling our money, we struggled with just making minimum payments month after month after month.  But now, slowly, we are seeing some payoffs for our efforts, and I’m finally starting to feel less like a prisoner of debt!  I know it will take years for us to be debt free (right now my main concern is the credit cards, THEN we’ll get into paying off the cars and both mortgages), but it’s really encouraging to know that there is a way out if you’re willing to commit yourself to a new way of thinking about your money.  And we will never, ever get into this situation again!!!!!\n\nThank you J.D. for this wonderful blog!!!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJulie says\n\t\t\t\t14 July 2008 at 00:59\n\nGreat article.

Since we are built to react to short term rewards, it is much harder for us to choose to make the decision that will benefit us less in the immediate future, but more in the long term.\n\nPersonal finance has some basic rules that are easy to understand, but hard in the short term to give up the immediate short term rewards (real shopping is sooo much more fun than window shopping). \n\nHowever, if we can set up a system that mitigates the feelings of the loss of these short term rewards, we will reap a much larger reward in the future.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tEric J.

There is such a huge emotional aspect to finance that a lot of people don’t understand.  I for one grew up financially illiterate in a family that always lived paycheck to paycheck going slowly into more debt.  So, I inherited those habits.  It took a lot of hard work to get myself right financially and distance myself from those habits.  Sure, it seems simple now–don’t spend more than you earn and save some money–but it was a hard road to get there.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBill says\n\t\t\t\t06 August 2008 at 12:45\n\nAnother thing commentators like the one you posted ignore is the MASSIVE pressure being put on us all to behave in a financially irresponsible fashion.\n\nAdvertisers, banks, lenders, credit card companies and even people who make products we really want or need spend BILLIONS of dollars to research and then implement what amounts to psychological warfare to get us to spend, borrow, spend, borrow, spend.\n\nEven a healthy, well-adjusted, strong-willed person would struggle under that barrage.

If I’m earning $500/mo. and rent costs $475, it’s simple to say I have $25 left. It’s not easy to cover everything left over after rent is paid. In fact, it is probably downright impossible.\n\nLikewise, if I’m making $10,000/mo. but I’ve got a $4500 mortgage and a $700 car payment, plus the gamut of regular expenses, I may not actually be able to come out ahead despite the advantage of a tremendous personal salary.\n\nMaking choices and prioritizing is never easy — it involves knowing ourselves enough to make choices motivated by our own best interest, even if that means choosing the harder choice. The person making $500 might need to work another job or find a cheaper way to live, or a roommate. The person making $10000 might need to evaluate whether they really are serving their needs with a lot of high-dollar expenses.\n\nEither way, choosing is hard. (and it’s not all about choice either — the $500 person might not be able to find cheaper housing or work for more pay. The $10000 person might not be able to easily cut expenses like a mortgage or loan.)\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJeremy Bettis says\n\t\t\t\t06 August 2008 at 12:50\n\nAdam: You are an idiot.

It seems like in your blog today that you completely overlooked that point.  \n\nThe simple truth is that if you were able to get over the psychological barriers that put you into debt in the first place (primarily the lack of ability to delay happiness), then getting out of debt and building wealth is very much so simple.

What about the person with diabetes or other health condition (such as glandular) who is required to maintain a certain diet or regimen of medication that causes weight gain?  Or the person who is unable to exercise due to prior injury or other medical condition?   Or even the people who cannot sleep regularly due to sleep apnia or other medical condition?  Most of those cannot be controlled by the individual as many are hereditary or genetic in nature, so simply saying “Eat better, exercise more, sleep more.” is just wrong.\n\nAs I referenced in post #2, try reading the last paragraph in my blog posting from yesterday for the correlation:\n\nhttp://letsblogmoney.com/2008/08/05/financial-advice-is-not-a-one-size-fits-all-proposition/\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJeff says\n\t\t\t\t06 August 2008 at 13:32\n\nAdam:\n\nEcon 101, Day 1: The economy is not a zero-sum game.

Some people are really naive (ie: this commenter) about the things that affect our decision making at a deeper level.

A paradigm of scarcity is usually the source of such statements as “since Bill Gates has $30Billion, then the rest of the world is $30Billion poorer.” This statement assumes that wealth is a zero-sum game. \n\nThe paradigm of abundance says, “Gates created an industry that has injected trillions into the world economy; it only makes sense that he has $30B.” The logic is that Gates didn’t take $30B from others; he created trillions and benefitted from his creation to the tune of $30B.\n\nI personally operate within a paradigm of abundance.

The problem isn’t in finding the “right” solution – we know the solution – but in finding the discipline. I suppose there is an argument over picking a sub-optimal way just because it has a higher success rate, but I think this sidesteps the real issue – we have an inherent bias that makes us not achieve what we want to achieve in the long term.  That’s the root cause and learning it won’t just solve the immediate problem, but pay off as you gain a new way to approach life’s problems.\n\nI see picking a sub-optimal solution as bypassing the important lesson to be learnt.  \n\nOnce you have the discipline and subscribe to following “the right way”, most things become academic… as was said, be it for weight loss, finances… even things like relationships, and incredibly complex and personal issue, tend to do better when we don’t impulsively let our wiring decide.  Same with anger and all sorts of reactions as well.  Work on our time preference, understand the real costs including opportunity costs and the outcome is your own optimized financial situation.\n\nThere is no golden rule as to how much we should save – we can see how saving can be negative when a miserly old person dies without ever enjoying life, too afraid to spend.  There is a balance to be had.  You only put off spending for so long, but this should be line with your life goals.  It’s a very important concept, IMO, and the foundation of good financial advice will start with the concept of balancing future goals compared to the present ones (the “save save” and “spend spend” messages aren’t holistic enough for me.)\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAdam says\n\t\t\t\t06 August 2008 at 16:14\n\n“The logic is that Gates didn’t take $30B from others; he created trillions and benefitted [sic] from his creation to the tune of $30B.”\n\nFrom where did those trillions come?

But I have to admit that our household income — the combination of two strong salaries — has played a significant role. Part of the reason not everybody is rich is that not every body has the cash flow to make triple mortgage payments or what-have-you. Not everybody was able to save for a downpayment when we did. Sure, many people were better off than us and still others made the choice to spend their money. But the fact is that the bulk of the population struggles to get by. And that’s in the “First World”. The rest of the world is not rich because $2 a day puts you in the top quintiles. Seriously.\n\nHabits are important.

On the path to gaining that discipline they may have to follow a sub-optimal mathematical option because it allows them short term wins, which So Cal Savvy points out so well in the first comment above, can be crucial in demonstrating the benefit of something you’re doing, especially if it’s something new to you.\n\nAlso, let face it, no one wants to be a loser or be considered a loser.  We all have egos and most folks have tied their self worth to their social status and material things.  Getting something “smaller” (be it a house, car, apartment, etc.) or doing with “less” (can’t go out more than once a month now) screams “loser”.  And they have lost!  These folks cannot support the lifestyle they’re portraying!  This is hard for many people to admit, both to themselves and others.  So needing those “wins” to demostrate they aren’t so much losing at life as they are gaining control in their lives can be a big deal emotionally.  \n\nAs they gain the discipline by seeing that they’re moving forward and the program is working, they can gain confidence and hopefully move to make better financial choices, similar to what Luke S. mentions above.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMark Nelson says\n\t\t\t\t07 August 2008 at 07:22\n\nPersonal finance should be easy.

It does have the feature of giving you more margin in your monthly budget.  As soon as you pay off that lowest balance debt, you don’t have that payment any more, and now you have a little more breathing room in your budget, which will help you avoid going back into debt.\n\nThere is a family that was in my last Financial Peace University class that can’t even pay their minimum payments on their debts.  So this man took an extra job working evenings and weekends.  When that smallest debt is paid off, they can make the payments and he can quit that extra job.  If he instead paid on the low interest student loans, it might be 3 years before he could quit his part time job.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tChicago Gal says\n\t\t\t\t07 August 2008 at 08:36\n\nI understand the concept of the 0% balance transfer idea but many of those deals tie to a card that has a higher rate after that introductory period. When people are already burdened by debt and costs higher than they can afford, they are not likley to have it all paid off in that 6 month period and will have a higher interest rate to deal with in the long run. It is also important to note that dealing with banks is a tricky matter that you might think. They aren’t always heppy to grant you the transfers or cancelations you want and relentlessly try to offer you alternatives to stay with them when you call. The plusses and minuses of these (marketing) deals offered isn’t always evident from the pitch they give you. It is hard to defend your territory with banks and credit card companies and it takes a lot of time, follow ups and dilligence to get things fixed. Some people have a hard time standing up to them and aren’t always informed of their options. \n\nThat said, I do believe the lowest debt amount and the highest rate methods both work and your personality kind of determines which one would work better for you. \n\nPersonally I have never had large amounts of debt to worry about but I have watched people all around me try and deal with it for years. It is very easy to slip into debt and very difficult to get out of debt because it is designed that way.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tmwarden says\n\t\t\t\t07 August 2008 at 08:43\n\nJeremy @42: Yes. It is very simple to verify this, too. Consider cash advances in credit cards. When you take a cash advance, it is charged at a higher rate of interest (usually). When you send in a payment to your account, the credit card company applies your payment to your purchase balance and NOT your cash advance, until your purchase balance is completely paid off. This is because the purchase balance has a much lower interest rate, so it is better off for the company to use your payment to pay off that low interest debt first.\n\nYou of course want that to pay off your high interest debt first. In this way, your $1 would pay off $1.25 worth of debt vs. $1.16 worth of debt (difference in 25% and 16% interest).\n\nThe same applies to different accounts.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBill in NC says\n\t\t\t\t07 August 2008 at 14:02\n\nSure, some people’s spending is not in their control.\n\nI thought my mom’s alimony was decent, until she got sick and needed nursing home care for the last 7 years of her life.\n\nWithout any prior family history, no one in their 40s (as mom was when she became ill) thinks about buying long-term care insurance.\n\nMost of those in trouble I meet, however, are indeed the “$10,000/month income, $4,500/month mortgage, $700/month car payment” type of people.\n\nThere is substantial opportunity for savings (and a rapid reduction in debt) for the latter group, with only a modest decrease in their spending habits.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMoneyEnergy says\n\t\t\t\t07 August 2008 at 14:24\n\nI might add that while one can devise a plan for getting out of debt, a whole other plan might be needed for STAYING out of debt.  That’s just as important.  I can pay off my cards easily, but if I overdo the process I’ll be back to needing them again in two months.  So this is where the emergency fund comes in.  But then you need to do the same process in reverse for the emergency fund.  You need to keep replenishing it.\n\nSo what might the answer be for both processes?  Spend less than you’ve got, at all times… it’s the only solution.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Farquhar says\n\t\t\t\t08 August 2008 at 09:13\n\nTo those who don’t like the debt snowball and would rather pay debt off in the “right” order, highest interest rate first: The difference between paying them off in the best order and random order is at worst a couple of months, including the mortgage (so we’re talking at least a couple of hundred thousand dollars of debt).\n\nSo if a person chooses to snowball their debts in a less than optimal order, that’s still much better than getting frustrated and giving up and then paying them off when they come due.\n\nI purchased my home in 2002. Today my wife and I own it and the two cars parked in the driveway outright. There are a lot of things we could have done differently, and perhaps gotten where we are a little bit faster. But any time I start to feel any regret, I just look at the $100,000+ we saved by not carrying that mortgage a full 30 years.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJen says\n\t\t\t\t08 August 2008 at 10:16\n\nWhile there’s no doubt self-discipline and moral fortitude are necessary if you want to get richer than you are, there are also always things outside our control.

My wife and I put our heads together and decided we needed a positive financial direction; spending everything we earn (and then some) is not a positive direction, but rather a very negative one.  Our debts were all current (several credit cards, an auto loan and student loans).  We paid the minimums and put together an emergency fund.  We then began working on our debt snowball, attacking the smallest debt.  We now ONLY have a little credit card and student loans left.\n\nThis DEFINATELY required a change of mindset on our parts.  We had to spend less than we made.  We put forth a budget each month and stick to it the best that we can.  Yes, emergencies come up.  To this point our emergency fund has covered them.\n\nIf this plan does not work for you, you have one of two issues:  (1) you spend to much or (2) you don’t make enough.  A lot of people spend all their money, but don’t know where it all goes!  Do a budget then – spend your money on paper before you get it in-hand and try to not stray from it!  If you just don’t make enough to cover your bills, you need to first prioritize them.  Then you need to address your income problem.  Perhaps you need another job!  Perhaps you need to sell some things to knock off some debt!  \n\nJen @ 48:  “Not everyone has legs to train for a 10k run” – if you approach personal finance with that attitude, you’ve failed before you even began.  Succeeding at personal finance is not a matter of aptitude; you need to WORK at conditioning your “personal finance muscle”, especially with respect to self-restraint and discipline, to succeed.\n\nOne last note:  since I began reading personal finance books (especially Thou Shall Prosper – Rabbi Daniel Lapin), I have found that my mind is working differently.  I have become more optimistic with respect to life in general.  I control my money, not the other way around.  That, along with the opened communication with my wife with respect to our personal finance, has made waking up each day much easier.  I’m not always worried about the bills.  I’m not worried about the dishwasher breaking.  I don’t worry as much about anything.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tThe_Overdog says\n\t\t\t\t09 August 2008 at 13:06\n\nI disagree that personal finance is at all easy without having studied it. It’s not. It’s hard.  \n\n1. The fact that certain debt is better than other debt is not a simple concept.\n\nFor example, when one person has a $20k car payment and the other has a $10k credit card payment, and they are paying them back at the same rate, how do you convince the person with $10k in credit card they are worse off?\n\nA 3rd person has a $40k college debt. Which of the 3 is best off? \n\n2. ‘spend less than you make’ is not as simple as it sounds. \n\nExample: Which person is spending less than they make? The person who pays $300 for a car repair out of cash, or the person who puts the repair on their credit card, and only pays $50 for it that month? $50 is less than $300 right, which is spending less? \n\n3. Large expenses that lead to greater future opportunities are difficult to comprehend. \n\n  For example:\n\nFor a person who is not wealthy but has an OK job, how do you convince them to spend $20k for schooling when their new starting salary will only be $2 or 3 more per hour than their current salary? \n\nAnd these questions are just off the top of my head. Personal finance is tough.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDan Tanner says\n\t\t\t\t09 August 2008 at 22:22\n\nSpend less than what you earn is a simple statement, yet hard to follow.

If we’d still been  paying interest on that loan we’d be up the creek.  It taught us just how expensive credit really is and it taught us that we can’t be trusted with credit.

We almost always classify certain things as “needs” when they’re really just “wants”, albeit wants that are socially expected norms in our society.\n\nHere’s a hypothetical set of “needs” for an American family of four:\n\n1) A two bedroom apartment.\n\n2) A car.\n\n3) Telephone service.\n\n4) Electricity.\n\n5) Running water that’s safe to drink.\n\n6) Three meals a day for everyone.\n\n7) Health insurance.\n\nThat would be a pretty sparse set of “needs” for most GRS readers. It would be really easy to add a third bedroom, a second car, and new clothes every year on that and still count them as needs. People *always* seem to classify their mortgage payment as a “need”, regardless of how luxurious their house is, the whole mortgage falls into the “need” category.\n\nEven still, the sparse list above would be a life of luxury for most of the world. Most of the world doesn’t have a car, or health insurance, much of the world lives without clean water, or three meals a day, or electricity in their homes. Yet these people survive, and many of them are even happy. So why do we, sitting here comfortably in the first world, get to classify these other people’s luxuries as our basic necessities?\n\nI think there are only “wants”. There are “wants that my neighbors will think are needs” and there are “wants that my neighbors will think are frivolous”. \n\nYou can really survive on very, very little, everything else is a “want”. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend you money on those wants, just that you should recognize that you could choose to live without them.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTeresaA says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 11:46\n\nTyler,\n\nYou’ve summed it up very well:\n\nTyler says “You can really survive on very, very little, everything else is a “want”. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend you money on those wants, just that you should recognize that you could choose to live without them.”\n\nSo, once we get past the most basic of actual needs, perhaps what we really have to recognize is what our “priorities” are.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\trdzins says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 12:45\n\nI have an old cassette tape set from Ron Blue which dates back to the 80’s I found this to be excellent.  Ron Blue is a minister and alot of his talk has religion in it however, there is alot to be gained from this book.  The book was an audio book called Living Debt Free.  If anyone can find the book in a thrift shop or pick up the cassette tapes if you still happen to have something like that around it is well worth listening to.  He goes in to how people will rationalize debt, even very smart educated and religious people, they also give out this type of advice for others to borrow money. So math has little to do with with our thinking about money.  It has everything to do with how we let money run our lives instead of controlling our own lives. That is how I felt, I felt that money controlled me, because I never had any and always worried about how I was going to ever pay my bills or get ahead, ect…  I quite letting money control my life by making sane decisions that are realistic, and not following the crowd or even smart peoples advice.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLinear Girl says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 14:16\n\nTyler – I agree with your distinction between wants and needs as well as with our intentional confusion of the two.  I must quibble a little with your analysis of your list, though.  You’ve got:\n\n1) A two bedroom apartment.\n\n2) A car.\n\n3) Telephone service.\n\n4) Electricity.\n\n5) Running water that’s safe to drink.\n\n6) Three meals a day for everyone.\n\n7) Health insurance.\n\nI define a “need” as something which is required in order to live, preferably in a reasonable state of health.  With that definition in mind:\n\n1 – We do need shelter, but not necessarily the full apartment.\n\n2 – For many a car is a luxury, but for others it is the only way to keep a job to provide for the rest of ones needs.  Mass transit and bicycles don’t cut it in many locations.\n\n3 – A want.\n\n4 – A want for the vast majority, a need for certain medical apparatus.\n\n5 – Clean water is a need all over the world.\n\n6 – Three meals a day aren’t a need but a minimum caloric intake is a need all over the world.\n\n7 – Health insurance isn’t a need, but health *care* is, all over the world.\n\nPeople reading this post almost certainly live where your list describes a very modest lifestyle.  For better or worse, our culture makes demands on us to meet certain standards that aren’t considered necessary in less affluent parts of the world.  An example from my e-mail today (I work in Finance at a large social services non-profit) was that a child mentioned at school that they had no food at home.  Child Protective Services were called.  Our case managers worked with the family to buy them food so that they could keep their child living with them.  It may be the standard in many parts of the world that children will go without food (and the chance to attend school at all would be a luxury), but here that circumstance will cause a family to fall apart.  Sometimes our needs really do vary by the requirments of the dominant culture; setting the poorest parts of the world as the standard is disingenuous.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tHealthyeaatingwhilebroke says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 14:17\n\nTyler, you are spot on.

I might offer one comment to this thread. There is “good debt” and “bad debt.” One might argue that a loan for educational purposes, which is in the nature of an investment in human capital, is good debt. Taking (or carrying) a mortgage at 5% might also be good debt. I might also disagree about shredding your credit card. I have one. Just one. I pay it off each month, in full. I wonder how folks book rental cars or air tickets, buy on-line, or do all the other myriad things we “do” without them.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBozo\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBob Smiley says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 15:13\n\nThe number one thing I found which started causing debt for me was to switch over and use a credit card for all of my purchases.  The idea was to do so for the consumer protection the card offers, then I’d pay off the credit card bill when it showed up.  Initially this worked, but after a while, I started getting into debt.\n\nThe reason?\n\nIt’s because using a credit card disassociates your spending from how much money you actually have to spend.\n\nSo, I ditched the credit card and went back to just using my debit card with a daily reminder of how much balance I have left in the bank.  As I spend, I can visually see how much money I have left.  The only problem with this is stores that delay when they withdraw the money.  Some will post a $1 withdrawal until they’re weekly transactions are ran.\n\nThe other thing that helped was to do the common advice of paying myself first.  Before I even see my paycheck 10% of it goes into my 401k (stock diversified).  When I do get paid, $200 is auto-drafted from my checking account each pay-check … $100 to a money market for long-term purchases that require continual savings (like a car), and $100 to a personal investment account I can dabble with as I see fit according to the market (where-as my 401k I just do dollar-cost averaging on).\n\nWith that taken out of my checking account before I even see it, I’m ensured I have a cushion to fall back on as needed, but also ensure I don’t over-spend my means.  If I get too much saved up in checking, I then manually distribute it to other investments.\n\nSo far, it’s worked very well.  Credit cards are nice for emergency spending and consumer protection, but if you can’t control your spending you need to just get rid of them.  I personally only have one, and only use it for large purchases I know I’ll cover next time the bill comes.  (EG: I bought a 150cc motor scooter for daily commuting, and put it on my credit card for consumer protection, then paid it off on the next credit card bill I got out of my long-term purchase money market savings account.)\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tHogan says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 15:22\n\nLineargirl,\n\nYour points are well taken. While people all over the world are struggling to get any sort of safe housing, adequate nutrition and potable water, in America we have CPS workers calling parents “unfit” and removing children from their homes, when the parents are unable to provide adequate dental care for their children. Our societal standards of what constitutes a “decent living” are much, much higher than in most areas of the world.\n\nThis is off the point of the original post, but I feel it bears repeating that how one defines a decent standard of living is subject to an enormous amount of cultural influence.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrugal Bachelor says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 17:00\n\n@Linear Girl – “Sometimes our needs really do vary by the requirments of the dominant culture; setting the poorest parts of the world as the standard is disingenuous.”\n\nYes, but using the richest parts of the world as the standard creates a picture which is just as skewed.\n\nA few reality checks:\n\n– Across the planet, only 13% of individuals own their own personal motor vehicle.\n\n– 92% of people outside America (which has, by far, the highest rate of personal vehicle ownership rate on the planet, and props the global figure up), do not own their personal vehicle.\n\n– USD$3,500/year is the average amount of money that an inhabitant of our planet lives on – which is readily apparent when you look at the type of dwelling they live in, the amount of energy they consume, how they get around, how they eat, etc.\n\nYou are right, we should not compare ourselves to the poorest people on the planet, but also when you look at the figures, the standard of living enjoyed by people in N. America (and Europe, Japan, etc.) is NOT NORMAL. The average standard of living – which is daily reality for literally billions of people who we share the planet with – is actually in between the poorest and the richest.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tkaty says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 17:23\n\nMy favorite PF book; kudos to you!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tkitty says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 19:55\n\n@Tyler Karaszewski 11 “It amazes me that this survives as a genre. You might as well have a fiction genre about sea captains who sink their ships in vengeful pursuit of white whales. ”\n\nLOL  – this is so cool.\n\n@moneyblogga, TeresaA:\n\n30 years in the US and I still don’t understand this about Americans – how they like to blame peer pressure or evil advertisers or anybody else but themselves.\n\nI grew up in the Soviet Union, we haven’t had any financial education, my parents got their salary in ruble bills… We haven’t even seen a check before we got to the US.\n\nBut when I got my first credit card in the US, I’ve never thought of the credit line as spending money. I’ve never even read the fine print – I simply looked at the interest rate, and I knew that if I can’t pay my balance in full, I’ll have to pay a lot more. This was one of the things that my parents taught me – to think about the bottom line.\n\nMy parents haven’t taught me about credit cards. What they taught me was a) borrowed money aren’t really mine: if I borrow money, no matter how much and no matter from whom I ALWAYS have to pay it back b) the value of money. My parents were never afraid to tell me when I was a little child that they cannot buy me this toy or that because it was expensive and because my mommy had to work X hours to earn it or that this toy cost as much as this other thing and that other thing. My parents were never shy in discussing money in front of me. I also had an idea of how much they would spend on what I wanted. I also learned to think about cost of different things in terms of how much a particular item was worth: e.g. a dress would be worth more than a toy, a winter coat, more than a dress, etc. I learned that if my parents normally spent $X for my dress, they will not buy me a dress that cost considerably more. This habit of having an idea how much I am willing to pay for something even before I check the price tag stayed with me forever. \n\nAs to peer pressure – the first time I told my parents that I did something because everyone else did it, they asked me “and if everyone else were to beat their heads against the wall, will you do it too?”. They also weren’t afraid to say that they couldn’t afford to buy me something someone else had or if they thought buying the same thing for that much money was stupid.  \n\nAs to “I want”, my mother always told me – “please feel free to go on wanting. Have I ever forbidden you to want something?” (sounded better in Russian, btw). Translation – you can dream about whatever you want, but this doesn’t mean you can get it.\n\nThey taught me to appreciate the value of money and to think of any amount of money in terms of what else this amount of money can buy me. I still do it; I also find that my perception of what is “cheap” and what is “expensive” changed very little since 20 years ago, yet I can afford now a whole lot more. \n\nWhen I was in grad school, I saved half of my teaching assistantship. I didn’t even try – the money were simply worth more to me than a number of things I could buy. I liked the money more. Now, I used the savings to go to Hawaii in summer – this was worth it for me. Items weren’t.\n\nThis is what you should teach your kids – the value of money. You should teach it long before they get in college. You should also teach them to always return their debts. A little math wouldn’t hurt either.  As to advertising – explain to them very early on and every time you go to a store that people want to sell them stuff, but that doesn’t mean they should buy it. Also – that they can never get something for nothing. \n\nWhen we were poor refugees, many of the refugee parents weren’t able to buy to their kids what their American friends in school could buy. Yet, all immigrant kids learned to deal with it.\n\n@Adam ” Adam says: “Teaching children about finances is not nearly as important nor productive as critical thinking in general. Raise them to analyze situations and ask intelligent questions and they’ll be much better off in life.”\n\nTrue. As well as plain common sense.\n\n@ Bob Smiley says: “It’s because using a credit card disassociates your spending from how much money you actually have to spend.”\n\nTrue. What anybody who wants to use a card should be able to do is think about the price of an item they want to buy in terms of dollars and cents (and in terms of what else the same amount of money can buy) without thinking about the card in their pocket. You also need to think about a credit card bill the same way you think about any other bill, e.g. a telephone bill. If you cannot do it – don’t use cards.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSaver Queen says\n\t\t\t\t08 April 2009 at 20:35\n\nIsn’t it interesting how a book written more than 20 years ago can be just as relevant today?

I sometimes seems like it is trying to drown me.  I am working as many extra shifts / jobs as my body will allow.  There are only 24 hours in a day.  I have a home, family of 5 with 3 kids in high school. I keep throwing money at my problems only to make them go away for a little while… then get behind on something else..The classic example of “too much month left at the end of the money”.

List everything. even utiltiies. Put it on a wall so you can see it everyday.  Slowly the debt will dissappear. Do not add debt to it.  When something is paid, start a new sheet. I list the debt, then each month reduce the amount as payments are paid, when I got to a zero balance on a debt I didn’t like seeing it on the board so I would start and a clean piece sheet.  PS: “I had $36,000 in debt when I started this ”  On my new  board I only owe for my car and I just bought a temperdedic bed. That is my only credit due , but now on my board I have what will be due for the rest of the year. I have a line for Geico, Property Tax, Birthdays, Christmas, Taxes “IRS”. Then I do list my utilities, Chevron, lights, heat, water. I do pay my utilities a year at a time, so I am now good for the rest of this year. But in January 2010. I will start over. At the top of my list will be my car, the new bed, what I will owe for all utilities for the year, all taxes, insurances,  birthdays, fixed expenses you will incur during the year, if I am planning a trip in the year.  It’s a BUDGET on a sheet of paper, so I can stay on track. Now that my debt is now manageable, I  have room at the bottom of my sheet and am now writing little stuff like, Just reasoning with myself, like, Christmas is coming do you need to spend so much on the grandkids a gift is fine, you don’t need to give them the world, the potluck at work, bring one dish don’t volunteer for everything, I am  trying to talk myself out of buying a Smart Car, I have up there, quit spending money. You don’t need it , just little pep talks to myself.  Debt consumes to much of your time and energy. I had to sacrifice, and I now don’t have any credit cards, I live on cash and now make better choices, The paycheck now has to last  till next payday, so I think first.   I did it you can do it too.

However, when you are in loads of debt and you are living paycheck-to-paycheck it can be very hard to save for an emergency fund.  The only way I could do this was automatically putting $2.00 a day into my savings account.  I know this wasn’t much but I also felt good that I was saving.  \n\nI have to tell you that now I am out of debt and into the savings habit my life has transformed.  I am so glad that I started saving $1000 a year in my 401k at the age of 24.  It may not seem like a lot but I started early and stuck with it.  Each year I was closer to getting out of debt I increased my savings.  Now, I have $29,000 in my 401k and I am 29 years old.  I am proud of this amount because 4 years ago I had zero and I was in $26,000 of debt (just checked this amount today).\n\nI wish everyone the best and just know that you can do it.  It is possible to get out of debt and save.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJanie\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tinjured says\n\t\t\t\t02 October 2009 at 22:58\n\nHow can you be free of debt if you need medicines to miantain in order to survive. thanks.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tRao-about to be free from debt says\n\t\t\t\t09 October 2009 at 01:58\n\nhi JD\n\ngreat post indeed!\n\nit took me 3 years to realize that i was trapped with credit cards and credit lines debt.the day when my boss gave me the increment, next thing flashed in my mind was  a credit card,…so happy !!!! now I too can apply and own my credit card, yahooo!!!! its because here in Singapore we need to have minimum yearly income.\n\ni applied only one credit card and i don’t know how the other banks came to know me suddenly…all the banks started calling me to offer CC’s. again I am very happy to accept all after one year i ended up with 7 banks x 2 cards = 14 cards in total.\n\nactual story started here, i spent money like nobody’s business at the end of two years i ended up with $30,000 debt.i didn’t realize that i was just paying for the interest and late fee only.one fine day i took down all the outstanding balances on paper, to my surprise, i still need to pay the amount i borrowed from banks, i just paid monthly interest and late fee only.\n\nso first thing i did was cancel all the unused cards,\n\nnext targetted at the cards with less amount to pay…other cards i paid fixed amounts and i got rid off few cards within one year i started seeing the results. clear the debt cancel the card or line of credit. now i only have 3 accounts to close and i have enough savings to close them.\n\nif i had a chance to read this article 3 years before, my life would be different.It took 3 long and bitter years for me to get rid of the debt. no fun, no entertainment, no parties, no outing at last a lesson learned….\n\nnow i have only one card that is linked to my savings online account and i think its useful and i am using it wisely.\n\nI dont blame banks for this, i blame myself for not using these tools properly\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDeedra says\n\t\t\t\t21 October 2009 at 17:51\n\nI have a question.\n\nI’m 29 years old and still going to college.

Thanks for sharing these guidelines. A lot of people I know could use this advice. Living without a credit card can be tough because we have become so conditioned to having them in our lives. I did some reading and discovered that in the early time period of American history, you were considered a social pariah if you had any form of debt or owed someone. I think that we should refurbish or economic system to do away with a debt-based currency altogether. This would encompass credit cards of course. Thoughts anyone?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSuzanne says\n\t\t\t\t16 February 2010 at 16:56\n\nEvery time I find articles on getting out of debt, they are about credit cards, and the advice is much the same. If I were in that situation, this is sound advice, but I do not have any CC debt, I own my car, and I spend the minimum on every part of my life that is possible and stretch every penny I have. \n\nCould you instead, speak a little about student loan debt, and balancing that with wanting to fund an IRA and a small savings? \n\nTo give you my situation, I will be graduating with approximately $140,000 in student loans (medical school), and will begin making a pittance salary for at least 1 to 4 more years in internship and residency, starting this summer.\n\n1) I would like to start paying some of this huge debt off with the pennies I earn in the coming years, even though it will mostly be deferred and I am not required to pay yet.\n\n2) I would also like to open a Roth IRA, and have a small ER fund.\n\nI am trying to figure out the balance of maxing out an IRA and forgetting about the debt for now (maybe pay a couple hundred a month vs killing myself to pay more) or balance the two goals and not be able to max the IRA while I am young because of my extremely low salary, or forgo a decent ER fund, etc. \n\nI suspect these dueling goals are at the heart of a lot of graduating students’ questions, even if they are financially responsible users of various nondeductible debts. \n\nThanks in advance, Suzanne.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTheRealDebtSolution says\n\t\t\t\t16 February 2010 at 20:21\n\nExcellent information!

I started a budget (on paper) a few months ago. I have $65K in debt and $50K of that is the mortgage. \n\nI made about $57K in 2009 but have never lived on a budget; I would have $600-$700 dollars left after paying all my bills (monthly). But before next payday I would be down to $40 or so dollars in my checking account and nothing to show for it. I am still not sure where it went. It couldn’t have been all those colognes I ordered online, LOL. But it was. I also have a few neices I like to spoil seeing as I have no kids and am single. \n\nNow, I budget my money. A few days before payday I write out a budget for the upcoming check. All bills due in the two weeks after payday are written down and budgeted for. I have been seeing that I have approx. $300 left over, so I auto-deposit half to savings and carry the balance over to the next budget in two weeks. My savings has grown exponentially since starting a budget on paper; it gives me a sense of having control if I manually write it down for now.\n\nThe next time I do the budget I have a “beginning balance” plus left over $ for that two-week period. I started the snowball on my debts and have to date paid off around $1900 in medical bills and drastically reduced the balance on the CC. I have a bank loan, and a family loan (0% interest) and, barring life’s little bumps, should be debt-free by Aug. 2010 (less mortgage), but then I can double or triple the principal payments without penalties.\n\nPrayer helps too!!!!\n\nps. there are many articles on becoming debt free, and, like this one, DaveRamsey.com is another good source.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTheRealDebtSolution says\n\t\t\t\t28 February 2010 at 20:24\n\nExcellent article…Finally more people are starting to think like I do.\n\nNo Credit Card for Emergency – Cash\n\nNo Credit Cards for Rewards\n\nNo Credit Cards for Rental Cars\n\nNo Credit Cards for Big Purchases\n\nNo Credit Cards to Save on Purchases\n\nClose the credit card accounts, pay them off ASAP – make settlement offers 1 at a time.\n\nEstablish an emergency fund of cash that you can assess without penalties.

I tried the Dave Ramsey approach and it did not address my situation.  I took a second job delivering pizza, cut expenses, etc. and deprived myself and still it didn’t work.  This one does work.\n\nDave Ramsey is about deprivation and this book is about treating yourself well while stopping incurring debt.\n\nDave Ramsey is about concentrating on lowering your amount of debt, focusing on that figure, and on preserving your credit rating.  \n\nThis approach does not focus on the amount of total debt so much or on your credit rating, but instead focuses on tracking spending, making a spending plan, paying your creditors (not necessarily what they are demanding), and working the program.\n\nDave Ramsey does not address the situation where your debt is way too high and you can’t pay the minimums on your credit cards and everyone is telling you to go bankrupt, but you don’t want to.  I looked at lots of other alternative financial gurus and none of their approaches worked for my situation.\n\nThis is an alternative that works.  It is counter-intuitive, so if you haven’t tried it, it’s hard to judge.  You have to do it on faith.  Scary, but it works.  You have to stop using credit of any kind even if that means that you can’t pay the minimums and will default on your loans and they will be hounding you, calling you constantly, jacking up the interest rates, late fees, etc.\n\nAlso, Dave Ramsey does the charismatic tough love thing a la Doctor Phil and tries to make you feel like an idiot, saying things like the “stupid tax”.  This only reinforces the sense of shame and low self-worth that led to this problem in the first place and complicates attempts to see the situation clearly and address it.\n\nThis book on the other hand, helps the person see the issues clearly by making a spending plan and keeping track of all expenses.  And it has a plan for paying back all debtors while putting yourself first and building some savings.\n\nPaying less than the minimum on the credit cards is scary because of the usurious interest rates, late fees, etc., but it does work.  You can eventually settle these accounts and become debt-free.  They will knock off the extra interest and late fees when they finally settle with you much later.\n\nYes, your credit score is damaged, but why would you want to get back into debt anyway?  Having a bad credit score is a blessing in disguise.  It helps keep you from incurring any debt.  \n\nAll these other financial advisors talk on and on about your credit score as if it’s so vitally important.  To someone with debt problems, it should be the least of their concerns.  \n\nThe best plan is to not need any credit or worry about your credit rating because you simply pay in cash.\n\nGreat book.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPaul says\n\t\t\t\t23 April 2010 at 06:35\n\nDebt is a behavior problem and one can’t get out of debt until the spending behavior is changed.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLaura says\n\t\t\t\t25 April 2010 at 17:18\n\nI have a very small limit CC that I use for things like buying online and such when I can find items that are cheaper or not available  locally.

Destiny says\n\t\t\t\t31 May 2010 at 07:46\n\nDepending on your unique financial situation, you may be able to simply modify your budget and reduce your expenses to keep up with your expenses better. For individuals with more debt than financial discipline can cure — it’s time to look at more serious options for negotiating debt reduction and repayment terms with your creditors. Call Your Creditors The first step toward improving your financial situation is to contact each of your creditors to let them know you are having financial difficulties. Particularly when dealing with credit card companies, there are often a variety of payment plans and special programs to assist consumers who are struggling. Credit card companies may be willing to stop adding late fees and interest for a temporary period of time, or reduce your minimum payment for several months, to help you get back on your feet. Call and ask your creditors what kind of arrangements they can make to help you make your payments. Loan companies and other creditors may not have as many options available, but calling them to ask is still a good idea. Sometimes loans can be refinanced with lower interest or a longer repayment term to give you more time to pay what you owe, and a lower monthly payment. If You Still Need Financial Help If negotiating new payment arrangements with your creditors isn’t enough to get out of the hole you’re in, you may need to consider debt settlement options or bankruptcy. A debt settlement company may be able to help you negotiate with your creditors for a one-time payment that is less than the total amount owed in exchange for “settling” the account. This one time payment, if accepted by the creditor, will close the account and your credit report will be updated to reflect that it’s been paid or settled — and that no further payments are owed. Not all creditors will agree to negotiate a debt reduction and you either need to pay off the total balance owed or consider bankruptcy. Whichever action you take to reduce your debt and improve your financial situation, take the time to look closely at how you manage your money to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTiffany says\n\t\t\t\t01 June 2010 at 10:14\n\n“Money is as much about emotion and psychology as it is about math” … Great quote to remember; it’s funny that I never considered money and math being related at all!

E.g. why would you have $5k in a 1% savings account and $2k on credit cards at 20%?\n\n2. Keep your credit cards open and use them every now and then to drive up your score even if you have cash in the bank (and the banks ‘value’ of you as a customer – since they get fees off transactions). MAKE sure you pay off the credit cards straight away – this requires some discipline.\n\nCheers, Mark\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAlmost There! says\n\t\t\t\t31 January 2011 at 13:30\n\nYou have to be 100% honest with yourself about why you got yourself into debt (yes, WHY, we all know how you did it).

I treated credit cards like a bottomless savings account.\n\nI used to make futile attempts at paying off debt by accepting zero interest credit card offers and “pay off” other credit cards with this balance transfer. One company I “paid” with the zero interest offer charged me $57 interest the following month. That is when it hit me that the credit card companies aren’t in business to help me, they are in the business to make money. I took action after I got over the shock of figuring out I had $11,000 in credit card debt that slowly crept up on me. In my mind, if I never added it up, it didn’t really exist. I thought if I am able to pay off a zero interest balance-transfer offer before it ends, I could do the same with any account with my own realistic, but aggressive deadline. I read a blog that suggested determining a solid monthly amount to pay down credit cards, so I tried it. $500 per month worked within my budget without drastically effecting my lifestyle. I started with the smallest balance first. I paid the minimum plus $5 on all accounts except the chosen one, and I would send the remaining money toward that card until it had a zero balance. Now I have $450 total (from $11,000)left to pay on only one credit card (2 payments) and it can’t happen fast enough! I set up my online banking Bill Payer to pay half my bills every other week, which is when I get paid (example: $100 a month payment, my bill payer sends in $50 first paycheck of the month, $50 second paycheck of the month for the same bill). I have control of when payments go out since it’s my bank account so I adjust it as needed, but that is rare since I started controlling my money instead of my money controlling me. I pay 26 payments per year instead of 12. It pays down debt faster and I still have plenty leftover to put into savings and go away on cash-paid vacations. It so refreshing not being a slave to due dates! I love watching the balances go down and my savings account and credit score sky-rocket! Since I started this, I am surprised how much money I actually have without increasing my income. I now understand getting rid of debt is what builds wealth. This took me just over a year to pay everything. I used overtime, gifts and tax returns to pay it down so quickly. It is a long process, don’t get discouraged, remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither was your debt. You need to find what works for you. We can all live debt-free with determination!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSteve says\n\t\t\t\t30 April 2011 at 06:51\n\nIf you have the flexibility it is best to measure your unfettered spending flow then fine tune down the areas that you can live without. Importing your statement for tracking is the truest way to make a budget happen long term. My MS Money application no longer works so I searched and found a program called bank2budget (www.bank2budget.com). This program cuts my time down in paying bills and tracking expenditures by 90%. I spend about 1 hour a month and can show you trends and many other charts. It requires MS Access version 2002 or higher though.

Nick doesn’t specify what type of debt he has….could be $8000 for a motorcycle or what’s left on a car loan, and he is a responsible credit card user. If someone can use credit cards responsibly (ie, don’t spend more than you would using cash and pay them IN FULL each month), there is free money to be made with cash back rewards. My husband and I put everything we possibly can on our credit card, pay it off in full every month using only one check, and get the following benefits for doing so (we use Discover mainly): no annual fee on the card, cash-back of up to 5% on regular purchases, access to the shopdiscover.com website where we can save 5-20% on our online purchses (even 5% at Walmart.com!), we use fewer expensive checks, we get a detailed printout of our expenditures every month (this helps us see where we might be overspending), we occasionally receive special coupons from Discover. Granted, we are very disciplined and don’t overspend and NEVER carry a balance, but we generally get about $50 a month back from the card and apply it to our statement balance.  Over a year, that adds up!!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJohn says\n\t\t\t\t18 September 2011 at 05:06\n\nI just can’t understand people with thousands in credit card debt. How does it happen?

If you’re giving them that much money in interest then they’ll try to hold onto you if you threaten to transfer your balance to a card with a lower rate.  Remember to only transfer balances if it’s not going to cost you more!!! \n\nStill not convinced that the snowball method is best, but then again I am more of a numbers person so I find it more satisfying emotionally to see larger numbers come off my debt.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSandra says\n\t\t\t\t30 November 2011 at 10:39\n\nI have a question concernant the debt snowball.

In the grand scheme of debts, we don’t owe very much but on the salary of a soldier and an administrative assistant they seem monumental. These are very old debts from when I was a teenager. I was so overwhelmed with these debts that I ignored them, and now if I pay the minimum on all of them I am unable to spare any money for an emergency fund or anything else for that matter besides the basic amenities. I am unable to take up a second job because we have two children, and daycare is already killing us just for after school care- besides that, I want to see my children once and a while. My husband is not able to take up a second job either as he is a soldier in the midst of preparing for a deployment. \n\nHow does one start this process when they can’t even get to the starting point. I really need advise because we have been living this way for far too long. Our 10 year anniversary will be shortly after my husband return and we want to be able to celebrate that (we didn’t even have a honey moon). We want to buy a house. We want to start our lives.\n\nWhat do we do?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSonja says\n\t\t\t\t27 December 2011 at 03:29\n\nJeanette, the answer is simple, although not easy to do.\n\nYou follow the same steps as given in the post.\n\nstep 1: Lower the money you spend and/or increase the money you get in.\n\nTheres plenty of tips on this. But it really means you’ll need to look at every single penny that’s going out and seeing if it’s going to something that’s necessary. Almost everyone can save some dollars here. \n\nStep 2: Get the emergency fund up. If nothing else works ask your bank (or whereever you have your debt) for a freeze, or lowering on payments for a few months. This will allow you to get some money into a saving account. \n\nStep 3: Pay off the debt. What works for me is paydown months. For 1 month I’ll be completely focussed on paying everything off I can. I will not buy some candy (candy is ALWAYS a luxury), I will not eat out, I will not by lunch in the canteen. I will save everything I possibly can. The next month I’ll still make sure I save when I can, but less strict. That way you keep live livable while still paying off.  \n\n—\n\nThe regarding the debt snowball. For me it worked better to have the psychologically heaviest debt first, rather than the smallest. (it’s acutally the biggest) It’s the one debt I lay awake fro during the night, so working on that motivates me more than paying of my other debt.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJulie Gaudet says\n\t\t\t\t18 December 2011 at 19:59\n\nBuilding a debt reduction snowball is the best way I know of to eat away at your debt.

Too many people consider their wants to be needs!  When you purchase something consider the total cost, not just the monthly cost (if you upgrade your cell phone plan–what will it cost each year and for the total contract, not just each month.)  Live a simple life.  Do not make lots of small daily purchases–make your coffee at home and do not spend $5 on a cup of coffee.  Pay off that debt and then save the money.  Having money gives you choices in life instead of having your lack of finances run your life.  When we spend money on a major purchase, we make certain that it is something we really want so we get the value of that purchase.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMonica says\n\t\t\t\t31 July 2012 at 17:18\n\nGood advice,\n\nIts just getting the well power and discipline to do it.

It can save a lot of gas and time when you run several errands at once. Seems like a no -brainer, but you’d be surprised how many people run errands willy-nilly.\n\nRemember to reward yourself when you reach a goal or send extra $ to pay off your debt. The small things matter! An extra hour of downtime, a hot bath, an evening of reading or a movie, an ice cream cone or that one latte this year all make for solid rewards. Or make yourself a sign to remind yourself all week long you just sent an extra $35 in to pay off your debt. It helps.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tlmoot says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 07:05\n\nThe obvious solution would be to stay out of debt, especially on a low income. Making not very much money early in life (and still), has been a blessing in disguise for me. Last year I earned 25k more than I was earning when I bought my house over 5 years ago. And I bought less house than what the banks told me I could afford, specifically because I was earning a “low income”. So not only am I paying a mortgage expected of someone earning much less than I currently do, but even less than that since I only borrowed 55% of what the bank was willing to lend (over 100k on a less than 25k salary!).\n\nAnyway. As someone with now an average income, and never expecting to make more than $30-50k from active income, I’ve made it my goal to focus on guaranteed savings/ investments. CD’s and working to pay my mortgage off early. Other than matching my company 401k match, and one day hoping to max my ROTH contribution, I don’t want to focus what I do have on playing market games. Perhaps if I had much more disposable income I would. And not to say that investing is not for low/average income earners, just that I’ve made the decision to keep it low-risk and simple. It’s always served me well and keeps my expectations realistic.\n\nOne area I’ve always had a problem with is food. Cooking is not something I’ve practiced enough to have a mental list of on-hand recipes, so it still takes effort for me to cook, and so I don’t. I want to change that as I spend way too much money (and calories) eating out. Not something I can afford on my budget, AND meet my goals at the same time.\n\nI would also include student loans on your list. Many people’s student loans are bigger than their car loan…or my mortgage! Not everyone is lucky enough to avoid student loans. I did, and I list that as one of the top reasons why I’ve never despaired over money after graduating. I didn’t need to feel the burden of having student loans, in order to enjoy how goooood it felt starting my adult life in the black. Not just financially, but mentally it provided me confidence going forward, and encouraged me to keep my finances in good standing. \n\nIt seems that some people with large student loans upon graduating might get an “oh well” attitude, and continue to add to the pile with other debt, making the additional debt less glaringly obvious. What’s a fly in a pool of leaves?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tlmoot says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 07:19\n\nWell I got caught up in my own psycho-babble and forgot to list my course of actions.\n\nIn 2009, within 2 wks I had both a mortgage and a new car loan (neither of which I’ve ever had before). My car died 2 wks after closing.\n\nI:\n\n1) I paid the car off in 9 months with the FTHB check I received with my tax return. It was money I was going to use towards renovating the house, but this new debt was a priority to me—especially after I calculated I was paying $100 in interest each month!\n\n2) I used minimum services and electricity. Only internet no cable, utilities (water, trash and electric) stayed under $100.\n\n3) I only used 0% interest debt. I financed most of the renovations this way. It allowed 100% of my payments to go towards principal (which goes down a lot faster when you’re not paying interest) and I just paid it off in full before each promotion expired.\n\n4) I renovated the detached studio on my property first so I could rent it out ASAP. My first tenant (best friend) financed most of the renovation and ended up living there for 2 years while attending school.\n\n5) I got a part time job I enjoyed, and which offered benefits that saved me money….benefits like being able to visit nearly every major attraction for free.\n\n6) Moved in with my grandmother last year and rented my house out. The tudio is currently being used for storage and needs additional work, but I intend to lease that out as well eventually and put the things in storage.\n\nI would say for someone on a limited income, definitely earning more is the best option, but not just earning more….earning different streams of income as well helps to hedge against things like job loss.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBritni @LazyGirlFinance says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 07:22\n\nThis post makes some really great points about reducing expenses.  Like losing that last ten pounds, it’s never easy to squeeze that last ten dollars out of a budget that is already so tight that it squeaks.  But there are ways.  It just takes the energy to put in that extra effort.  \n\nMy only criticism is that this post doesn’t really get into another great way to reduce debt – increase income.  In the first line, the post mentions selling stuff, but that’s not the only way to make money.  Desperate times call for desperate measures, and a second job might be the answer.   \n\nWhen I graduated from college, I couldn’t find a job in my field (engineering) until more than six months after graduating, despite spending hours looking every day.  Instead of continuing to rack up even more credit card debt (I was already under a mountain), I moved into my aunt’s basement and took a job as a sales associate at the mall.  It was about the last thing I wanted to do at the time.  But it was necessary, and it worked.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tKT says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 07:26\n\nThis reads pretty inauthentic.

It reads like somebody came up with this idea for an article, and then the author had to scramble to come up with things to say.\n\nI don’t have any first-hand anecdotes to share either.  But I’d say that the first step for someone in debt on a low income (or any income, really) is to figure out how bad their situation really is.  Add up all your necessary monthly expenses: housing, transportation, insurance, basic groceries, the minimum payments on all your debts, any other payments that you must make every month and can’t postpone.  Compare that number to your monthly take-home income.\n\nIn a sustainable spending plan, “must-have” expenses should make up no more than 50% of your take-home income.  If you’re struggling with money, you’re probably nowhere close to that figure, but how far off are you?  If you’re at 70-80%, determination and a few tweaks may be enough to dig you out of your hole.  But if you’re at 100% or more, your next best option might be to meet with a bankruptcy attorney.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLux Ganzon says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 08:23\n\nI like these tips!

It is a very rare person who has small income and large debt. Unless you have had a bad reduction in income, chances are the low-income debtor is drowning in what would seem a trivial problem to the high-income debtor.\n\nThe GOOD news for the low-income debtor is that any old second income will help a lot. Dave Ramsey often refers to “The pizza delivery job.” The person who makes 6 figures and is 7 figures in debt will not make significant headway with an extra $200 a month. But the low-income person who adds that much income (10 hours per week at minimum wage) AND APPLIES ALL OF IT TO DEBT REDUCTION can pay off $4000 in debt in less than two years, and $4000 probably pays off at least one monthly bill for a low-income debtor. 🙂\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tsarah says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 10:01\n\nI agree.  I grew up with parents who were low income and at one point under a lot of debt (job loss, debilitating injury, 80s real estate crash, balloon payment).  The only options were to work more and/or not spend money on ANYTHING if it was avoidable.  \n\nNow I work with folks on social security and when you only get $721 a month and your rent is $600 (the cheapest you can possibly find here, probably a shared room in a terrible neighborhood), owing someone even $500 is a nightmare.

For me, a big part was learning to cook from scratch and not buying the convenience foods in the grocery store. It turns out chopping your own carrots can save you a wad of cash over time (and staying away from canned is much healthier too). \n\nAnother thing that helped me manage my low income was moving somewhere with a lower cost of living.

I got a part time job at the mall to cover basic expenses and start attacking my CC debt, while continuing to look for a full time job.  Cutting living expenses and getting an extra job was all I could do to keep my head above water.  \n\nEventually, I did get a job in my field which paid pretty well, and I was able to pay off the remainder of my debt in time.

But I put something in savings each month, even if it was less than $100.  I chipped away at my debt – paid off my small car loan first, then tackled the student debt.  And while in those first few years I never made a ton of money, by the time I met my wife five years later I was debt-free and had a pretty nice sum in the bank.  It was a matter of paying off one debt at a time, never letting my lifestyle inflate with my paycheck, and keeping some emergency funds set aside.\n\nI credit the following with my success; as you can see I echo some of the comments already made above:\n\n1) Strict budgeting.  I still had fun with friends, but it was cheap fun.  I volunteered with friends.  We got together at each others’ houses instead of going out.  Etc., etc.    \n\n2) I started giving to my church and never stopped.\n\n3) I learned to cook.  I took this to somewhat of an extreme – my wife still makes fun of how I could cook a lasagna and eat it for five days straight back in the day.  But that saved a huge amount of money over the years.\n\n4) I am an extreme gearhead, but I did not buy a flashy car until I actually had the money, and had already figured out the finances for a house.  Then I bought a slightly used Mustang GT.  It was worth the wait and felt a lot better doing this when I was well-established than it would have to go into hock out the wazoo freshly out of school.  \n\n5) I had no cell phone, and no cable/satellite TV.  At one point I didn’t even have a TV and I didn’t care.  \n\nToday, we are a family of four.  No debt save the mortgage and car loan, and my wife gets to stay home with the kids.

These decisions can be really hard to make but getting out of debt is a huge win. Although some of these suggestions, such as moving, cost money up front, they can have a tremendous impact in the long run. There can also be quite a bit of room to negotiate with credit card companies – and it doesn’t cost anything to try. Call your credit card company and ask them to lower your interest rate. If a big expense pops up, call them and ask them about postponing or derring payments.

I agree that (1) you have to be willing to truly suck it up, which is very hard to do when you HAVE been sucking it up for years and years and years, and (2) REALLY go through the spending and be willing to do some uncomfortable things.  Some will say that the person wouldn’t be in debt if they had actually sucked it up before, but people can indeed be on very tight belts and still have debt for non-frivolous reasons: e.g., student loans, an ex-spouse charged up the card before hitting the road, medical debt, and using the credit card to buy food for your children because you’re out of cash.  So I’m not going to judge.\n\nPaying off debt on a low income requires thinking way outside the box.  I would add to the list: (1) Look at any government programs you qualify for, then put any savings towards debt. (2) Avail yourself of food pantries and other charities, again putting savings towards debt; you can keep track of the savings and when times are better, donate that amount or more back to those charities. (3) Look for any barter situations you can come up with. Can you trade a skill you have for someone else’s? I once traded filing/paper organizing for a free massage. A parent might trade babysitting time with another parent. (4) Can you get quick gigs such as odd jobs off of Craigslist, or temp work? (5) Check out Debtors Anonymous for emotional support that you most likely really need.\n\nOne big problem is that people with money debt often have time debt too. In our society, time = money (used to be land = money) so if you don’t have more time to trade for money, your problem is compounded.  Do the best you can with what you’ve got.\n\nI would also add, (a) surf the internet for ideas of how other people did this and see what works for you, and (b) don’t get demoralized or see yourself as a failure; “economic recovery” or not, there are still a lot of people in bad straits and you’re one of many, not somehow special in a bad way.\n\nMy $0.02, k-chink.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJacque says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 11:45\n\nI agree with the general sentiment of the comments, this article missed the mark. \n\nBut I WOULD like to give a hearty shout out for cloth diapers! After gifts, my husband and I spent ~$250 on new and used diapers and supplies last year. Our little one is almost a year old and they should continue to fit her through potty training and work for any future siblings as well. Even if we changed our minds and decided to stop, their resale value used is ~$400 so we could potentially MAKE money off of diapering!\n\nWhile I appreciate each family has different situations, it frustrates me to no end to listen to parents complain about their finances when they are shelling out a small fortune on formula, packaged baby foods, diapers, wipes and diaper creams every month!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSherry says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 12:53\n\nTo Jacqui’s list I would add using cornstarch instead of baby powder, plain unscented almond oil (provided nobody’s allergic) for not only baby but adults as a skin moisturizer, cider vinegar watered down to use as both a hair rinse and detergent-remover in the rinse water for laundry….  The list goes on.  There are innumerable self-sufficiency sites out there, and if you’re not out every evening working your second job (like I often am) take some time to look online for them.  Years ago, Amy Daczyn (sp?) published a book called The Tightwad Gazette and Carla Emery did her Old Fashioned Recipe Book (which was about a lot more than just cooking).  \n\nA last suggestion my friends get a kick out of is, given my water heater is at the far end of my house from the kitchen, I remind myself I don’t need hot water for absolutely everything (like rinsing out a cup or giving my hands a quick wash) so I’ve rubber-banded a dollar bill around the hot water faucet.  \n\nAs Dave Ramsey would call it, “visual aid” and the more aware I am of the blessings I have, the less careless with them I become.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tstellamarina says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 20:31\n\nRe the water heater.

We used to have it on for two hours in the morning and two hours in the early evening but now that it is just me in the house I have the hot water turned on only for two hours in the evening.  I shower and do my dishes then.  If  I need to wash dishes in the day I will heat up some hot water in the kettle.  I think it stops a lot of wasting water as well. Usually there is enough warm water in the tank for a warm shower in the day time as well.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMilissa says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 13:42\n\nAfter our youngest child incurred almost $1 mil in medical bills last year, our savings was wiped out.

While my situation is deemed almost a ‘stage in life’, I had to work a bit harder to get by with no help from outside sources like other college kids get.\n\nA few things I did (disclaimer: some not always the most ethical, but they helped me get by!)\n\n– I took toilet paper from the public restroom my apartment’s front office, campus, etc. (dire straits) My campus also gave out free feminine products and other necessities, which I took advantage of a bit too much. I hoarded ‘freebies’, ketchup packets, etc. Never…technically illegal.\n\n– I cooked a lot of pasta and beans, and used primarily spices to ‘spice up very basic and cheap foods\n\n– I walked a lot instead of driving — sometimes a couple miles just to hang out with friends for the night. I could save a whole tank of gas a month by doing this.\n\n– I wouldn’t buy most food if it wasn’t on sale or I couldn’t find a coupon — this included ‘cheat’ day on my budget by ordering pizza\n\n– I did freelance work in addition to working a job\n\n– I tried to find the most effective jobs — at my age and without a degree yet, housekeeping or waitressing were the most lucrative\n\n– I never bought alcohol or other guilty pleasures — I’d host get-togethers at my place so I had to go out less (and in return there were a lot of leftovers at my place)\n\n– I found the cheapest possible housing, had endless roommates, and at one point lived in government-assisted housing\n\n– I had a friend go on food stamps when she needed it, and it helped her out a lot during that time in her life. My situation wouldn’t allow because I was a dependent technically, although I didn’t get financial help directly\n\n– I asked friends who weren’t as in bad of a situation for rides (or just to drive wherever we went)\n\n– I made sure to get an apartment that offered as many amenities free I would spend money on anyway — like free gym membership or gym area.\n\n– I took advantage of my college campuses resources even after I wasn’t in school anymore. One year I lived within walking distance to campus so I had no Internet and went on-campus for that. I went to the library for entertainment, used free refills on drinks at campus dining — at one point I even had a friend that lent me ‘free meals’ because he had a meal plan that had meals always going to waste anyway.\n\n– At my new job, I always drank coffee/tea at work, and never bought my own. There are a few other incentives that I take advantage of as well.\n\n– I also tried to plan out as carefully as possible my errands. This caused less trips to the store, more coupon/discount usage, and avoiding buying things I don’t need.\n\n– I never ended up taking advantage, but a local church of mine gave out free meals — food they got as free donations that were leftovers from various grocery stores in the neighborhood. It wasn’t a religious based event, and was open to everyone. There are likely organization that do this elsewhere as well.\n\n– I’ve thought of donating plasma/blood/hair but never got around to it. I had plenty of friends that did. When you’re really desperate, just plasma donations alone can cover most of a cheap rent!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tEmma | iHELP Student Loans says\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2015 at 17:43\n\nYou’re making a great point about the discomfort involved in getting out of debt.

I was in this position years ago, with $7k on a credit card and a lousy job. I was bicycling everywhere and lived in my friends’ dining room, and putting every dollar I could towards paying down that debt, but it never seemed to get my anywhere until I actually pulled back a little bit and started putting something into savings. The problem was that anytime I’d start to make progress, something would come up that I needed to put on the credit card again, because I didn’t have any cushion at all built into my budget! This became crystal clear after a bike accident landed me in the hospital, adding another thousand to the credit card.

The math nerd in me would hate to put extra payments towards a lower interest loan than a higher interest one. The avalanche method will also get you to be debt free the earliest. I can see an exception if cash flow is an issue. In that case, the freedom from completely paying off a loan or two does have a huge benefit. If you don’t need the extra cash flow today, use the avalanche method and become debt free ASAP.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJoeHx says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 12:30\n\nI’m the same way – I see the numbers before I feel the emotions. So paying the debt with the highest interest rate is the most motivating for me.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDon says\n\t\t\t\t05 March 2018 at 17:52\n\nSo, if you are a “math nerd” why or how would you get yourself into debt in the first place?

May be turn it into a challenge for yourself. I have gone through periods of my life when no amount was too small, every single expense was scrutinized and evaluated. Every cent that could be spared went off into paying the debt. I thought of it as fighting a war, and that was a war we won!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJoe says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 06:50\n\nWow, psychology is such a huge factor. I didn’t know people feel lost once they’ve paid off their debts. That’s very counter intuitive to me.\n\nI think financial security is probably a better goal. If that’s your goal, then paying off debt is just one of the steps.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tS.G. says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 15:27\n\nPaying off debt is just like any goal. Once you achieve it you can feel adrift for a time if you don’t have your next goal lined up.

It makes sense to me – it’s uncharted territory. \n\nI’d be curious to know what percentage of people feel down/depressed after paying off debt. If they’re truly without purpose in their financial life, like you suggest, that number could be high. But I am guessing many people are probably of the “Okay this is awesome, I’m seeing great results, but now that I’m out of debt, I don’t know what’s next. Someone please help me and let’s keep the good times going!” camp.

I looked at the math too, but figured any extra money with regard to interest rate, was justified by considering the extra money spent as education expenses.  It was a relatively cheap degree!!!  I gradgeeated a few days ago and have multiple diplomas (letters from various creditors stating my account has been paid in full).\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMichael says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 09:37\n\nI feel like the Ramsey method is best for most people because while paying the high interest off sooner is nice we generally make not smart decisions. I do feel for me being a very analytical mind paying off the highest interest first is best for me. Since Finance can be psychological this is why Ramsey method can work quicker giving you a reward sooner giving a better positive feedback loop.\n\nOn the debt being a side effect I dont think that is the case.Sure saving can lead to debt reduction but it can lead to asset build up or savings. If your priority isn’t to pay off the loan you may be tempted to put in savings or 401k which in general would earn less than most loans accrue. This can be extremely bad if you make min payments then something bad happened to you such as losing your job. Because then you have to dip in 401k pay penalty. \n\n Also, I think one should have active goals and target goals.I liken it to a ship you can have action goals that turn the ship and target goals that act as landmarks to see you are on the right track. With these, you can adjust or maybe question why are you not there. \n\nI think if you don’t have targets your actions might be the wrong ones to take especially on more abstract goals where the actions may not be clear for the end result you want. Conversely, if you have a goal of pay all my debt and don’t set actions you will have a hard time getting there.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJean says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 11:46\n\nI have never had an issue with debt, but I don’t understand why the Ramsey snowball method is so popular and why people in trouble default to this.  I would think that watching your total debt drop more quickly would provide more satisfaction than seeing the number of creditors fall.  How can you reconcile continuing  to pay off acounts but seeing the amount you still owe remain high because the accounts with the higher interest rates continue to grow?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.D. says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 11:50\n\nBecause, Jean, if your highest-interest debt is your highest-balance debt, the process can seem to take forever. This was true in my case. I read all the books that said you must pay off your high-interest date first or you’re an idiot. So I tried it that way many times. Many times, I failed. I never seemed to make a dent. But the very first time I tried the low-balance method first, it was a revelation. I snowballed my way from start to finish. Many many others have experienced the same thing.\n\nThis works because humans are not computers. We are complex psychological and emotional creatures. If we were purely logical, none of us would ever get into debt in the first place! Folks like me get the math. The math is easy. It’s the psychology that can be tough.\n\nPlus, let’s not forget that the actual dollar difference between the low-balance first method and the high-interest first method usually isn’t much (as a percentage of total debt).\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tS.G. says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 15:26\n\nPlus: paying off debts changes your cash flow. Even if the same amount is going to debt it can feel as though you’re paying more because your minimum payment has gone down.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDon says\n\t\t\t\t05 March 2018 at 17:57\n\nGetting the little ones out of the way really did my mind (and budget) a lot of good. It felt awesome to start being smart with money and seeing things quickly drop off my list. I hated the biggest debt the most and that was my driving force to get to that one and get it out of my life.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tS.G. says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 15:24\n\nA math geek way of looking at it, especially if cash flow is a problem, is what debt has the biggest difference toward your cash flow. Divide the payment by the balance and you’ll get another number. In your case:\n\n    Computer Loan: $1116 @ 15% ($48 min)….$43 per $1k\n\n    Personal Loan $1600 @ 3% ($100 min)….$62.50 per $1k\n\n    Car Loan $2250 @ 5% ($170 min)….$75.50 per $1k\n\n    Business Loan $2800 @ 11% ($30 min)….$10.70 per $1k\n\n    Personal Loan $6430 @ 0% ($60 min)….$9.30 per $1k\n\nIt’s a different way of looking at it and will often wind up similar to Dave Ramsey’s method because the closer you get to paying stuff off, the lower the balance and the more money you save for paying it off. But if you’re tight and don’t have an emergency fund it can help you address the stress of having the debt if something unexpected should happen.\n\n    Home Equity Loan $21000 @ 6% ($100 min)\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMichael says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 17:41\n\nCan you give a little more detail on this method? I am looking but I must be missing something how are you getting the numbers for instance 43 per 1k?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tS.G. says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 21:56\n\nSure. $48/$1116 is about $43/$1000. Just divide the payment by the number of thousands you owe.\n\n1000*[Payment] / [Principal]\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMichael says\n\t\t\t\t16 January 2018 at 15:39\n\nYeah I just misread and was doing 1116/48. Also for this method or any of the other methods how would you tackle a loan that is pulled. I have a 282.82 min payment on the total debt but it is comprised of 7 different loans(with different loans and different balances) and I do not have a min on those.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tS.G. says\n\t\t\t\t16 January 2018 at 19:37\n\nI’m not sure I understand the setup you’re describing. Can you designate additional payments? Is there anything in your agreement that designates how over payments are distributed?\n\n\t\t\t\tMichael King says\n\t\t\t\t17 January 2018 at 04:24\n\nFor some reason, I cant reply to your comment so I will reply to mine. The loan is  7 loans each with own balance and interest. My provider pools the loans into one loan and figures out a pooled apr then calculate how much it will take to repay over 10 years. In my case, it is 282.39 that is my min payment for all 7 loans. However, You can make additional payments to the loan and dictate which of the 7 it goes toward. Your loan payment first pays the interest then it pays some on each loan(I am not sure how they calculate this) for some it might be 5.34 towards principle. Then the rest goes toward the loan you want if you designate if not it goes toward highest interest rates. But as you pay ahead your loan won’t generate as much interest as first calculated making you pay it off quicker. Also I want to use this method but, it becomes hard when you have each individual loan. Right now I am paying off the high intrest but wonder if it would be better to pay off the smaller ones and increase the cash flow or not.\n\n\t\t\t\tlmoot says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 19:26\n\nThat is a cool method! It makes sense even more than the snowball method, b/c different companies charge difference amounts, or percentages for the minimum. So you could have a higher debt with a lower minimum payment, than a lower debt…if the minimum rules/formula for that particular bank, produces a higher amount.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tlmoot says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 19:20\n\nI have a different motivation since all of my debt is at 0% interest, minus the mortgage. Due dates. Last year I was close to $50k in credit card debt (I’ve paid off $20k since then, and am now down to close to $30k). I have them ordered by “promotion end date” since all my credit debt (including the $20k I paid off), are at 0% interest. I don’t want to pay it off earlier, because I like earning interest for as long as possible, but I still need to be motivated to save so that I can pay it off when the time comes. Therefore I push myself to save the target amount earlier than the due date (the “complete by” date), so that I can let the money sit and earn in a CD or high yields savings account. The quicker I save up the expected balance due, the longer it can earn interest.\n\nHere is an actual detailing of my current debt load, in order of due dates. It’s color coded as well, but that won’t show up here:\n\n1000/5000, Cap 1, complete Jan 2018 (due June 2018) (20% complete)\n\n0/1000, HD, complete Feb 2018 (due July 2018)\n\n0/3000, Cap 1, complete April 2018 (due Aug 2018)\n\n0/7000, Citi, complete July (due Aug 2018)\n\n0/1000, HD, complete July (due Aug 2018)\n\n0/6000, USAA cc2, complete and due Sept 2018\n\n0/1000, HD, Jan 2019\n\n0/2000, HD, Aug 2019\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMichael King says\n\t\t\t\t17 January 2018 at 04:28\n\nI would be careful doing this as it can be riskier if something happens to you. Also, some of them will have some conditions that will change the 0% to a 20 something %, for instance, missing min payments.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tlmoot says\n\t\t\t\t17 January 2018 at 15:03\n\nYes, it is definitely risky. I am very on top of paying the minimums, and saving money to pay it off by the promotional due dates. I’m currently carrying more debt than I normally would because of some expensive and needed renovations to my rental property, But I generally prefer to stay under 50%, even 30% of my total credit card limit.\n\nI’ve been using credit cards as free short term and semi-long term loans for a while now.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFoxTesla says\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2018 at 22:18\n\nI continually face this debt-attacking conundrum, with the question of “should I really be attacking it?” thrown in. We do have two auto loans paired with the mortgage, but with the autos being at 1.84% and 2.25%, and the mortgage being both the high balance and high interest at 3.875%, I struggle with the motivation to pay them down when my 401(k)/529/other investments have soared (12%ish gain since 01Jan2017, last time I checked) in the same timeframe.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWindy Taylor says\n\t\t\t\t16 January 2018 at 07:55\n\nI have always been a saver, but my husband was never taught good financial habits. When we got married in 2009, I had zero non-mortgage debt and he had around $300,000 in debt – car loan, credit cards, law school loans,mortgage and a HELOC on a rental property, etc. You name it, he (and his first wife) financed it. Additionally, he was obligated to pay $1,000 a month for five years in alimony, which we imagined as the financing for the world’s most beautiful invisible BMW.\n\nWe used the Dave Ramsey debt snowball, because I listened to his radio show. It took us five years to pay off everything but the mortgage on the rental property, and we sold that property in 2015. I used a spreadsheet to track each month’s payment and the outstanding balance of every debt we had. I would definitely use this method again, and would recommend it for less math-nerdy types. If you’re not great with money to begin with, you’ll be less motivated by a math-intensive explanation of how to order your debts, and perhaps more motivated by the quick win of paying off a small debt fast. \n\nThe #1 piece of advice I’d give to someone just taking the helm of their financial ship is this: Play the long game. Don’t think in terms of month-to-month. Plan one year, two years, three years out. Also, have an emergency fund. Lots of small stupid nonsense can derail your debt-reduction habit, and a couple thousand in an emergency fund insulates you from a lot of small stupid nonsense.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBonnie says\n\t\t\t\t16 January 2018 at 10:31\n\nThanks so much for this article, JD. My highest-balance credit card is also my highest-interest rate card, and so I’m currently attacking the smaller one. The psychological aspect of it that you mentioned is very real. The higher-balance one seems almost insurmountable to me right now, but I know it will seem more doable once I can knock out the smaller one.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tS.G. says\n\t\t\t\t16 January 2018 at 12:25\n\nGood for you!\n\nHonestly, the best advice from this isn’t which to do first it’s “Pick one and pay any extra money to that one until it’s gone.

I used Dave Ramsey when younger and was made deathly afraid of student loans so I wound up not finishing college. Now I’m finishing college and once finished will get a job that pays around $20k more than what I make now. I’m sorry but I wish I’d have been more willing to take out a $15k-20k loan and get a higher paying job instead of the decade of $12k-15k a year.  I make around $40K now (only for a year and a half and was lucky to get it). So I like how your approach is less obsessive and just a target. Something to happen along the way and not obsess over.

In some respects, it doesn’t really matter where you are in your journey because, no matter what you need help with, there’s a book that covers it.\n\nDeciding which book to read when, though, can be a bit of a challenge. So we created this huge collection of personal finance books to help with that. Here’s how it works:\n\nMain Sections\n\n1st Stage: Understanding the basics\n\n2nd Stage: Setting financial goals\n\n3rd Stage: Building wealth\n\n4th Stage: Financial independence\n\nKids and money\n\nWe divided the books into four main sections, based on the stages of personal finance. And we also added a section for kids and money.\n\nAnd then we broke each main section down into sub-sections to highlight specific needs and interests. Click on any of the hyperlinks to go immediately to that section or group of books.\n\nThe first book of each sub-section is selected to appear there because it appeals to the majority. If you have no time to read other books, start with that one.\n\nBooks we consider essential reading are marked with a happy star .\n\nSome books are linked to Amazon.com if you want to read more about the book or purchase it.\n\nFor each book, we include the readers we believe will get the greatest benefit from the book so you can scan through the list to find a book tailor-made for you.\n\nBut don’t ignore other books on that topic! There are many that are still worth the read. They would make a great gift even if it’s not what you need.\n\n1st Stage: Understanding the Basics, Tackling Debt\n\nBasic personal finance for beginners\n\nBasic personal finance for recent graduates\n\nBasic personal finance for under 30\n\nBasic personal finance for everyone\n\nBasic personal finance for lower income\n\nReducing debt for everyone, especially recent graduates\n\nReducing compulsive debt\n\nBasic Personal Finance for Beginners\n\nThis first set of books is geared toward beginners. Even if you’ve picked up a lot of financial know-how through the years, revisiting some classics in this category may sharpen your frugal skills if you feel too much lifestyle inflation creeping in. And if you find yourself back in debt, crack open one of these books again.\n\nThese books offer a wide view, discussing many aspects of money. They offer advice about saving, investing, and getting out of debt. They don’t go into much detail about any one subject, but they provide motivation to get started — and that’s what’s most important.\n\nThe Total Money Makeover\n\nby Dave Ramsey\n\nFor beginners\n\nChristian-focused\n\nAnti-credit cards\n\nContent: Ramsey’s seven baby steps to financial freedom form the core of this book. By following these in order — and not moving on to the next until the current step is complete — readers gradually progress from debt to wealth.\n\nApplause: Ramsey’s advice strikes cynics as simplistic. But his steps work because they are simple and because they provide tangible results. Your $1,000 emergency fund isn’t just cheap insurance against real life; it’s a visible reminder that you have succeeded, that you can save, that you can be smart with money. The debt snowball is built around quick wins which give you the confidence to continue.\n\nCriticism: Ramsey takes a lot of criticism for his support of the debt snowball, which he describes in detail here. However, Ramsey’s method is not easy. It requires sacrifice, hard work, and focus. In fact, printed on the bottom of every page of “The Total Money Makeover” is the book’s motto:\n\n“If you will live like no one else, later you can live like no one else.”\n\nIf you’re struggling with debt, there is no better starting place than this book.\n\nYour Money: The Missing Manual\n\nby J.D. Roth\n\nFor beginners\n\nGreat reference guide\n\nEasy to read and follow\n\nContent: J.D. Roth wrote “Your Money: The Missing Manual” precisely to be the sort of book he needed when he was struggling with money.\n\nApplause: I think it’s a great resource, getting to the heart of a broad range of topics. As J.D. put it, his book took the best tips from the best books and presented this info in plain English so that anyone can get out of debt and start building wealth.\n\nIn his review, Kevin Kelly (the founder of Wired magazine) wrote, “This is the best user-guide to personal finance I’ve found, and I’ve probably read them all.”\n\nCriticism: None — because I’m partial! 🙂\n\nSoldier of Finance: Take Charge of Your Money and Invest in Your Future\n\nby Jeff Rose\n\nFor beginners\n\nSoldier lingo\n\nContent: Each chapter ends with a checklist of things you should have accomplished as well as a bulleted summary. You won’t find any new financial information here, but you will find new metaphors. Rose also shares personal stories from his experience in the armed forces.\n\nApplause: The book is action-oriented. Rose wants you to be a doer, not a talker.\n\nCriticism: The soldier metaphor gets a little old.\n\nThe Richest Man in Babylon\n\nby George Clason\n\nFor beginners\n\nEasy to read\n\nGood introduction to personal finance\n\nContent: Clason offers personal finance wisdom in the form of parables. These nuggets of wisdom were originally distributed as pamphlets at banks and insurance companies during the 1920s. The most popular were collected into book form. This is the grand-daddy of personal finance (Benjamin Franklin is the great-granddaddy), and many of modern admonitions — “Pay yourself first,” “Invest for the future,” “Learn the power of compound interest” — can be found here.\n\nApplause: Common sense advice that everyone can use.\n\nCriticism: The format may be a deal-breaker for some.\n\nThe Simple Dollar\n\nby Trent Hamm\n\nFor beginners\n\nSimilar content to the simple dollar blog\n\nContent: Along with frugality, savings, and investing, there are chapters on social capital, networking, and relationships. Hamm says all of frugality can be boiled down to five simple rules:\n\nDon’t give up the things you love.\n\nFind inexpensive ways to enjoy the things that are important to you.\n\nCut back hard on the things that matter less.\n\nNever go shopping without knowing exactly what you want.\n\nUse the 30-day rule for any unplanned purchase.\n\nApplause: This book isn’t really about personal finance. There’s personal finance in it, sure; but like Trent Hamm’s blog, The Simple Dollar, it is about personal and professional transformation. This is a book about change.\n\nCriticism: It’s repetitive. Hamm’s writing style is weak and wordy. The message? Good. The delivery? Not so much.\n\nBasic Personal Finance for Recent Graduates\n\nThe Money Book for the Young, Fabulous &amp; Broke\n\nby Suze Orman\n\nRecent graduates\n\nPeople with student loan debt and/or credit card debt\n\nJob-seekers or under-earners\n\nContent: This is a comprehensive overview of how money should fit into your life, divided into 10 chapters. In this book at least, Suze’s advice is based on the assumption that if you’re truly broke, the ideal option is probably not available to you and you shouldn’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\nApplause/Criticism (depending on your perspective): Many of her recommendations fly in the face of traditional personal finance advice.\n\nBasic Personal Finance for Under 30\n\nI Will Teach You to Be Rich\n\nby Ramit Sethi\n\nPerfect for under 30, single, and making a decent living\n\nBoth strategic and tactical\n\nGood for automating your finances\n\nContent: Ramit stresses that “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” is highly tactical, and he’s right. He doesn’t just encourage readers to find the best savings accounts; he walks them through the process. He provides scripts for requesting rate reductions from credit cards and banks. He demonstrates his method of automating his financial life. He describes how to come out ahead in salary negotiations.\n\nApplause: “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” is packed with solid advice, cites its sources, and provides scores of tactical tips for managing money. Smart, bold, and practical. “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” is packed with tips that actually work. This is a great guide to money management for 20-somethings — and everybody else.\n\nCriticism: Ramit has a strong authoritative voice. He’s bold, sarcastic, and even a little sassy. Not everyone likes this. If you’re turned off by his blog, you’ll be turned off by his tone in this book. And if you’re married with kids, struggling to make ends meet, you’re not the intended audience.\n\nBasic Personal Finance for Everyone\n\nYour Money or Your Life\n\nby Dominguez, Robin, and Tilford\n\nFor everyone\n\nSimplicity or minimalist-focused\n\nIntensely practical\n\nContent: The authors play off the concept that time is money in a very literal sense. They encourage readers to sort out priorities, to cut expenses, and then to seek passive income in pursuit of financial independence.\n\nApplause: This is a classic, an excellent book. And also, even though this book was written years ago and has influenced many prominent personal finance bloggers, its perspective still feels fresh and unique.\n\nCriticism: It can become a little New Age-y in spots.\n\nPersonal Finance for Dummies, 5th Edition\n\nby Eric Tyson\n\nFor everyone\n\nGreat reference guide\n\nContent: The book includes assessing your financial fitness, setting goals, saving more, spending less, as well as insurance and preventing identity theft. This book can help you figure out why you have the relationship with money that you do, identify aspects of your financial life that need adjustment, and help you develop good habits going forward. Additionally, the assumption is that making positive financial changes will be easier if you can connect it to goals that are important to you.\n\nApplause: The format makes it easy to flip back to sections when you need them.\n\nCriticism: Keep in mind that this book is about general personal finance and not specifically geared to investing.\n\nBasic Personal Finance for Lower Income\n\nAll Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan\n\nby Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi\n\nLower income readers may appreciate this one\n\nFor make-a-budget haters!\n\nContent: This book’s balanced money formula is probably the single most important part of many people’s current financial plan. This book offers a different perspective than many personal finance books.\n\nApplause: For those who complain that most financial advice — including that at Get Rich Slowly — is geared too much toward the middle-class and isn’t appropriate for those who earn less and are struggling, “All Your Worth” may offer some answers.\n\nCriticism: The book takes a dim view of frugality and thrift, and it contains some wild assumptions (like 12 percent stock market returns). But with time, I have come to appreciate the strength of “All Your Worth,” not just for those struggling to shake off debt, but also for those of us who are beginning to build wealth. There’s good stuff here, though you may need to filter some of the authors’ rhetoric.\n\nReducing Debt for Everyone, Especially Recent Graduates\n\nFor beginners, debt reduction is the most important task. I know from experience that this can seem like a long, lonely battle. But others have fought it before and have lived to document the process. Here are two books that describe different approaches to winning the fight.\n\nDebt is Slavery\n\nby Michael Mihalik\n\nGreat for recent graduates, but good for everyone\n\nContent: “Debt is Slavery“ is a deceptively simple book. It’s short. Its advice seems basic. And it’s self-published, so how good can it be? It’s good. He covers a lot of topics that other authors shy away from, such as, the effects of advertising, the weight of possessions, and the soul-sucking misery that comes from a bad job.\n\nApplause: Mihalik’s advice is spot on. This book may be short, but it’s definitely sweet.\n\nCriticism: But then again, being short, it doesn’t go into too much depth.\n\nReducing Compulsive Debt\n\nHow to Get Out of Debt, Stay Out of Debt, and Live Prosperously\n\nby Jerrold Mundis\n\nFor those in debt, especially compulsive debt\n\nContent: “How to Get Out of Debt” is built on the principles of Debtors Anonymous, a 12-step program founded in 1971 to help those who struggle with compulsive debt. Jerrold Mundis was himself a debtor, and he based this book on his own experience. This isn’t purely theoretical information from the mind of some Wall Street finance whiz who has never struggled; this book contains real tips and real stories from real people.\n\nApplause: If you’ve tried Dave Ramsey without success, read this. It’s 20 years old, but the information is timeless.\n\nCriticism: This book is better for someone that is just getting started addressing their debt.\n\n2nd Stage: Setting Financial Goals\n\nFrugal living for beginners\n\nFrugal living for stay-at-home moms\n\nFrugal living for recent graduates and lower income\n\nFrugal living for minimalists\n\nThe psychology of money\n\nFinancial journalism\n\nReturn to main sections\n\nFrugal Living for Beginners\n\nSaving money is a key skill to develop if you hope to get rich. (Read “The Millionaire Next Door” if you don’t believe me.) These books can help you learn to cut corners, to save money in ways that may not have occurred to you.\n\nThe Complete Tightwad Gazette\n\nby Amy Dacyczyn\n\nFor beginners\n\nParents\n\nEspecially lower income-earners\n\nContent: “The Tightwad Gazette” was a newsletter published during the early 1990s by Amy Dacyczyn (pronounced like the word “decision”). Eventually, the back issues were collected into a series of books which were, in turn, collected as “The Complete Tightwad Gazette.” Dacyczyn wrote articles like: “Used Shoes: Are they Good or Bad?”, “Budget Bug-Busting,” “Tightwad Toys,” and “Saving Money on Your Mortgage.” Sounds just like a personal finance blog, doesn’t it?\n\nThis book has thousands of tips, many of which were contributed by readers of the newsletter. (You won’t find any info on investing here. This book is about being frugal!)\n\nApplause: I have read this book cover to cover at least three times. I have flipped through many other articles more than that. This book is one that I want to always have on my shelf. Plus, she is funny.\n\nCriticism: As much I love this book, it is outdated in certain areas. It’s not always easy to find specific information, and I miss investing advice.\n\n365 Ways to Live Cheap!\n\nby Trent Hamm\n\nFor beginners\n\nA year’s worth of one-paragraph tactics for saving money\n\nContent: Along with focusing on useful and practical tactics for saving money, Hamm also includes two chapters of general tips for flexing your frugal muscles — things like, plan ahead for car replacement, install a programmable thermostat, exercise more frequently.\n\nA book like this doesn’t lend itself to easy review. It’s not meant to be read from cover to cover. Instead, use it as a resource, as a pool of ideas. Looking for ways to save on electronics? Pull out “365 Ways to Live Cheap!” for tips like this.\n\nApplause: This is a compendium of tips (or “tactics”), and as such, it succeeds admirably.\n\nCriticism: Hamm’s book isn’t for everyone. It’s not trying to be “The Tightwad Gazette” or “Your Money or Your Life.”\n\nFrugal Living for Stay-at-Home Moms\n\nMiserly Moms\n\nby Jonni McCoy\n\nStay-at-home moms\n\nHelpful as an introduction to frugal living, especially if you’ve never had to be concerned about money\n\nContent: Don’t judge a book by its cover. Sometimes it’s the most unassuming of books that offers the best advice that can actively help you on your quest to get rich slowly.\n\nApplause: Miserly Moms is ostensibly a guide for stay-at-home mothers but is actually filled with useful tips for anyone who is concerned with frugality (especially parents with young children).\n\nCriticism: The cover!\n\nFrugal Living for Recent Graduates and Lower Income\n\nWealth on Minimal Wage\n\nby James Steamer\n\nGreat for recent graduates and families with low income\n\nEasy to read\n\nShows that financial independence can be attained\n\nContent: This book offers hundreds of ideas on how to avoid debt, maximize your wages, save on insurance and utilities, and generally live a frugal lifestyle.\n\nApplause: Filled with good advice, but be careful about going without healthcare.\n\nCriticism: A bit out of date, and maybe a little radical.\n\nFrugal Living for Minimalists\n\nThe Joy of Simple Living\n\nby Jeff Davidson\n\nMinimalists/supporters of simple living\n\nComprehensive reference guide\n\nCovers home, office, vacation/Ttavel\n\nContent: This book is packed with tips. Davidson covers a wide range of topics; and for each, he offers several ways to save money.\n\nApplause: A great resource for anyone wanting to cut down the clutter of life.\n\nCriticism: But then again, if you have a bit of experience with your finances, maybe it won’t exactly be groundbreaking information to you.\n\nHow to Live Well Without Owning a Car\n\nby Chris Balish\n\nIf you’re not interested in getting rid of your car, this isn’t the book for you\n\nIf you’re on the fence about getting rid of your car, this is the book for you\n\nContent: Balish begins by explaining why you’re better off not owning a car — financially, ecologically, and socially. He spends the rest of the book describing how to survive without one. He offers tips for mass transit, walking, bicycling, and more.\n\nApplause: If you’re in its target audience, it is worth a read.\n\nCriticism: This book has a narrow focus.\n\nPsychology of Money\n\nHow we feel often affects how we spend. And sometimes we have unconscious triggers that trick us into spending more money! Here are some books that illuminate this connection so we can achieve financial goals.\n\nThe Happiness Project\n\nby Gretchen Rubin\n\nFor anyone seeking to improve their happiness\n\nContent: I’ll admit that, on paper, “The Happiness Project” may seem sort of lame. Rubin decided to spend one year consciously pursuing happiness. Each month, she tackled one specific aspect of life — marriage, work, attitude, and so on — and during that month, she attempted to master a handful of related resolutions she hoped would make her happier.\n\nFortunately, the book isn’t lame. Rubin’s style is warm and engaging. Though “The Happiness Project” includes tons of info from research into happiness and well-being, this data isn’t presented in a dull, dry way; it’s neatly woven into Rubin’s account of her day-to-day progress toward happiness (or lack thereof). She shares the research in casual prose, not in academic jargon.\n\nApplause: I’m guessing that for many GRS readers, a personal happiness project could lead to increased wealth — financial and otherwise.\n\nCriticism: None. Well, actually, I mean it’s hard to find fault with happiness! But the book honestly isn’t about your finances, so maybe that should be said.\n\nSecrets of the Millionaire Mind\n\nby T. Harv Eker\n\nReaders with big goals\n\nCreate a blueprint for your success\n\nOffers action steps you can practice to become more successful\n\nContent: There’s a little personal finance advice here (all of it solid), but mostly this book is about changing the way you think about money and about yourself.\n\nApplause: I found “Secrets” inspirational. It’s a good choice for somebody with big goals or somebody trying to overcome negative thinking.\n\nCriticism: If you’re looking for a book with lots of personal finance advice, this book isn’t it.\n\nChange Your Life in 7 Days\n\nby Paul McKenna\n\nFor anyone wanting to reprogram their responses to money\n\nContent: Most of his books, like this one, are accompanied by DVDs/CDs to help induce a hypnotic state so that the lessons become part of your subconscious. McKenna’s aim is to help people reframe their experiences so that they can both achieve their goals (like losing weight or paying off debt) and also become mentally flexible enough to take advantage of unique opportunities as they arise. By training yourself to approach and react to situations in particular ways, your responses can become more productive and you can more successfully manage stress.\n\nApplause: If you are interested in digging into your psyche to discover why you act the way you do with money and want to reprogram your responses so you can approach money matters in a productive and positive way, “Change Your Life in 7 Days” may be a useful book for you. And because it has so many applications beyond personal finance, it may be useful to a wider audience as well.\n\nCriticism: Some of his recommendations are a little woo-woo in my estimation.\n\nWhy Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes (and How to Correct Them)\n\nby Gary Belsky and Thomas Gilovich\n\nIf you’re not achieving the financial success you should be, read this book\n\nContent: In this short book, Belsky and Gilovich catalog a menagerie of mental mistakes that cause people to spend more than they should. This book covers more than a dozen psychological barriers to wealth and explains how to prevent them from sabotaging you.\n\nApplause: What might have been a boring topic becomes fascinating thanks to an engaging style and plenty of anecdotes and examples.\n\nCriticism: One criticism I might level is that the book isn’t very scannable, meaning that it’s not laid out so that you can easily find your topic and read what interests you.\n\nThe Paradox of Choice\n\nby Barry Schwartz\n\nFor everyone\n\nUnderstanding consumerism in today’s marketplace\n\nContent: Schwartz argues that the vast array of choices available to us in the marketplace actually make us less happy. We’d be better off with two options for a wide-screen plasma television instead of 22. Too much choice doesn’t just make us unhappy, it prevents us from making smart decisions.\n\nApplause: Fascinating stuff, and it has a bunch of New Yorker cartoons in it.\n\nCriticism: It’s written from an academic perspective if that’s off-putting to you.\n\nYour Money and Your Brain\n\nby Jason Zweig\n\nIf you are interested in the relationship between money and our behavior, read this book.\n\nContent: Zweig covers the latest research into how money affects our behavior. Zweig’s extensive footnotes point to tons of great research studies about how we handle money.\n\nApplause: There are a lot of interesting books out there about the psychology of personal finance, but this is the most comprehensive.\n\nCriticism: It’s oddly one-sided — information about the problems, but very little about solutions to the problems.\n\nMind Over Money\n\nby Ted and Brad Klontz\n\nFor anyone interested in how we relate to our money\n\nContent: “Mind Over Money” won’t teach you how to budget, and it doesn’t ever mention index funds. This isn’t a book about the nuts and bolts of personal finance; it’s a book about how we relate to money.\n\nThe authors argue that our relationships with money are complex and not entirely rational. Our financial behavior is influenced by psychology and emotion and, especially, our personal history. We’ve all developed money blueprints that shape how we deal with our finances.\n\nApplause/Criticism: “Mind Over Money” doesn’t provide all of the answers you need to correct your money blueprint, but I don’t think that’s the point. The strength of the book isn’t in the answers it provides, but in the questions it provokes.\n\nFinancial Journalism\n\nThis trio of books won’t help you get rich — at least not directly. They don’t contain overt stock tips, guidance about personal finance, or advice for frugal living. Instead, they tell real-life stories about certain aspects of finance.\n\nDen of Thieves\n\nby James B. Stewart\n\nFor anyone that is interested in the dark side of the market\n\nContent: It’s not just Bernie Madoff. Wall Street has fallen prey to all sorts of unscrupulous men over the course of its history.\n\nIn “Den of Thieves,” Stewart takes us inside the high-finance worlds of Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Martin Siegel, and Dennis Levine. These men were embroiled in the insider trading scandals that shook the market during the 1980s, and through their stories we’re able to see just how much corruption the influence of money can bring.\n\nApplause/Criticism: A little dense at times, but it’s a great way to learn about the market.\n\nThe Making of an American Capitalist\n\nby Roger Lowenstein\n\nFor anyone interested in Warren Buffett\n\nContent: In this biography of Buffett, Roger Lowenstein describes the events that shaped his life, starting as a boy in the early 1930s. As we follow Buffett’s growth, we learn about the development of investment theory. In addition, there is plenty of information here about Buffett’s investment philosophy.\n\nApplause: Entertaining and educational.\n\nCriticism: It is more the story of his life as opposed to his investment techniques.\n\nHard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression\n\nby Studs Terkel\n\nHistory lovers\n\nContent: Writer Studs Terkel published “Hard Times” in 1970. It features excerpts from over 100 interviews he conducted with those who lived through the 1930s. Terkel spoke with all sorts of people: old and young, rich and poor, famous and not-so-famous, liberal and conservative.\n\nApplause: By including the perspectives of so many different people, Terkel is able to paint a richer picture of what things were like during this period.\n\nCriticism: This might be helpful if you are going through a difficult financial period, but there isn’t a lot of detail to each story.\n\n3rd Stage: Building Wealth\n\nMaking more money\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nAchieving success\n\nFor beginning investors\n\nFor intermediate investors\n\nInvesting for everyone\n\nReturn to main sections\n\nMaking More Money\n\nMeeting our financial goals often requires making more money — sometimes a lot more. These books cover different money-making methods so you can get ahead.\n\nOvercoming Underearning\n\nby Barbara Stanny\n\nPrimarily for women\n\nContent: This book is about asking for more, creating more, and working your way through the psychological pitfalls that lead to being satisfied with less in the first place.\n\nAs a reporter, Barbara Stanny interviewed 150 high-income women and wrote a book about them, “Secrets of Six-Figure Women.” In the process, she learned that the big difference between highly successful women and less successful women was how they valued themselves and what they were willing to do to get what they wanted. They didn’t think of limits, and they surrounded themselves with people who also were successful.\n\nApplause: “Overcoming Underearning” is a good book, and it’s in line with Get Rich Slowly’s ideals. If you need to get started — or have started but have hit a wall and you don’t know why — this might be the book for you.\n\nCriticism: However, the book contains few actionable steps that will help you make more money or invest well. If you need a how-to book, keep looking.\n\nThe 4-Hour Workweek\n\nby Tim Ferriss\n\nHigher income earners interested in mini-retirements\n\nContent: This book is filled with inspirational anecdotes and provocative ideas about how you can make the leap from desk jockey to the pursuit of your dreams — all while investing less time into your work. The flow of ideas is relentless. An intelligent reader can easily extract a wealth of useful ideas from the book.\n\nApplause: Despite its flaws, “The 4-Hour Workweek” is a great book. I think that most people can draw something useful from it.\n\nCriticism: A lot of the advice seems impractical and out-of-reach for the average person.\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nThe Other 8 Hours\n\nby Robert Pagliarini\n\nWannabe entrepreneurs\n\nContent: First, the book offers ideas to finding more time and making better use of the time you have. However, the heart of the book (over half its content) describes how you can make the leap from passive consumer to active Cre8tor™. Cre8tor™ is Pagliarini’s term for folks who make things, and in this section he urges readers to tap into their entrepreneurial side.\n\nPagliarini includes his list of top 10 channels, including blogging, inventing, starting a company, freelancing, and turning hobbies into income. For each channel, he offers basic guidelines and resources for getting started.\n\nApplause: As a huge proponent of earning extra income, I liked this section. I wish more people understood how quickly they could improve their cash flow by boosting income. This book is excellent for people understanding how making more money can improve their cash flow dramatically\n\nCriticism: Reading Pagliarini’s proprietary terms (Cre8tor™, etc.) gets old rather quickly.\n\nThe Incredible Secret Money Machine\n\nby Don Lancaster\n\nWannabe entrepreneurs\n\nContent: This hard-to-find volume from 1978 looks like a get-rich-quick book. It’s not. It’s all about starting and running small businesses, especially craft businesses. To Lancaster, a money machine is any venture that generates what he calls “nickels.” Nickels are small streams of revenue from individual customers.\n\nApplause: If your goal is simply to earn a comfortable income for yourself by doing something you love, then this book can help you explore the idea of business ownership.\n\nCriticism: The groovy ’70s lingo threw me off a little.\n\nThe Eventual Millionaire:\n\nHow Anyone can be an Entrepreneur and Successfully Grow their own Start-up\n\nby Jaime Tardy\n\nWannabe entrepreneurs\n\nContent: After finding out that corporate America wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be and racking up significant debt (~$70,000) while on a six-figure salary during that process, Tardy left that world behind to focus on being happy. Today she runs the website EventualMillionaire.com. She’s interviewed over a hundred millionaires to track down some common denominators in financial success, and this book shares her discoveries with you.\n\nIn other words, while this book is intended to make some connections and give you some guidelines, it’s not going to do the work for you. Taking action is your job. You can be intimidated by that … or inspired by it. Tardy votes for inspiration.\n\nApplause: This book might be for you if you…\n\nare inspired by others’ success (without expecting to replicate it exactly)\n\nenjoy worksheets and lists of action items (without getting bogged down in them and failing to follow through on the big stuff)\n\nand have always wanted to start your own business.\n\nCriticism: Some of the reviewers on Amazon were disappointed with the grammatical errors and felt that there was not much new ground shared.\n\nMoney Making Mom\n\nby Crystal Paine\n\nStay-at-home moms who want to earn money\n\nContent: This is Paine’s third book. Crystal Paine is the blogger behind the massively popular blog Money Saving Mom. In this book, Paine shares her challenges with starting businesses in the past, real-life examples of moms who are making real money, and practical tips for replicating some of her success.\n\nApplause: I appreciated the real-life stories and examples. This book makes making extra money feel within reach.\n\nCriticism: To me, most of the examples felt more like businesses just added to the family budget, instead of businesses that actually supported entire families.\n\nThe $100 Startup\n\nby Chris Guillebeau\n\nEntrepreneurs who want to bootstrap their businesses\n\nBased on thorough research\n\nGuide format\n\nContent: To say Guillebeau did some serious research is an understatement. More than 1,500 entrepreneurs were considered for inclusion in the book. They had to meet the following qualifications:\n\nMake at least $50,000 per year from their business.\n\nStarted the business on a very low budget. (The average cost of initial investment for entrepreneurs included in the book is $610, with a median cost of $125.)\n\nWilling to cough up financial data and demographics.\n\nApplause/Criticism: This is an actionable guide that you can customize. If you have zero desire to start a business or if your goal is to be the founder of a big Internet startup, this book isn’t for you. But if you’re interested in starting a small business doing something you’re passionate about, I highly recommend it.\n\nWork The System: The Simple Mechanics of Working Less and Making More\n\nby Sam Carpenter\n\nOverwhelmed business owners\n\nContent: After spending years running his business out of his head, lunging from one emergency to the next, trying to physically and financially keep the company running, Carpenter had a life-changing epiphany that transformed his relationship to work, to home, and to other people.\n\nCarpenter discovered the value of creating step-by-step instructions or systems for almost any process that encompassed his business. Once those systems were in place, anyone within the organization could follow the procedures and accomplish the objectives and goals of the company. He stresses the importance of first developing strategic objectives, general operating principles, and then working procedures (the fluid part of the Work the System method) to maintain a healthy sense of control.\n\nApplause: What I thought was going to be a theory filled with holes and short-cut tricks turned out to be something to which I could relate. Though Carpenter focuses on his own company and the application of the steps to creating systems, the concepts carried over to my world outside of telecommunications.\n\nCriticism: Although this material is applicable to more people, the primary audience is business owners who are overwhelmed.\n\nAchieving Success\n\nWealth is about more than money. These books will help you become a well-rounded person and will help you develop skills that will indirectly aid your personal finances.\n\n50 Success Classics\n\nby Tom Butler-Bowdon\n\nReaders looking to gain knowledge quickly\n\nContent: Butler-Bowdon selected 50 important books from success literature. For each, he created digest versions, summarizing each volume in only a few pages, distilling its key points. He also provided biographical information on each author, and attempted to explain why each book is relevant, placing it in a larger context.\n\nApplause: If you don’t have time to read all 50 books, this gives you an option to get the concepts quickly.\n\nCriticism: And if you want to read all 50 books, this book is unnecessary :).\n\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People\n\nby Dale Carnegie\n\nReaders interested in improving their relationships\n\nContent: One of the classic success books. Carnegie uses anecdote after anecdote to illustrate the best way to make the most of human relations. It all boils down to this: “To win others to your way of thinking, put yourself in their shoes.”\n\nApplause: The devil is in the details, and Carnegie’s simple prose does a fine job of pointing the way.\n\nCriticism: Even though this is a beloved classic book on relationships, I came across an interesting criticism on Amazon. It pointed out that, because it was written so long ago, the culture has changed and some of its principles may actually steer people in the wrong direction today. But I still think there’s a lot to be gleaned from the book.\n\nGetting Things Done\n\nby David Allen\n\nReaders looking for systems\n\nContent: Little needs to be said about this book — it’s a geek classic. Allen describes his formalized system for creating greater efficiency. Though I’ve found it difficult to maintain the precise system for long, I use elements of it all the time.\n\nApplause: If you have trouble procrastinating or staying organized, this book is for you.\n\nCriticism: Although I have implemented some of Allen’s systems, GTD feels clunky and complicated as a whole.\n\nNever Eat Alone\n\nby Keith Ferrazzi\n\nAnyone who wants to create/improve their social network\n\nContent: This book helps you learn how to relate to people, how to establish contacts, and maintain connections.\n\nApplause: Worth reading if you have contact with a wide group of people.\n\nCriticism: Networking for the sake of networking puts me off. The endless name-dropping gets old fast.\n\nFor Beginning Investors\n\nLearning to invest your money wisely is obviously one important aspect of building wealth. Wall Street is not friendly to the small investor; instead, it’s designed to part you from your hard-earned dollars. These books can help you develop an investment philosophy that can help you improve your odds of retiring wealthy.\n\nThe Random Walk Guide to Investing\n\nby Burton Malkiel\n\nFor beginners\n\nContent: Malkiel is best known for his classic “A Random Walk Down Wall Street.” This book is shorter, written in plain English (there’s no investing jargon), and is easy to understand. But that doesn’t mean it’s simplistic.\n\nApplause: This is an excellent book, filled with advice based on sound financial principles. It covers risk tolerance, asset allocation, diversification, and even a little behavioral finance. An excellent guide for beginners.\n\nCriticism: If anything, the criticism would be that it’s for beginners.\n\nThe Smartest Investment Book You’ll Ever Read\n\nby Daniel R. Solin\n\nFor beginning investors or anyone investing in actively managed funds\n\nContent: If you have recently or will soon be entering the land of full-time employment, 401(k)s and 403(b)s, then this is probably a good book for you to read. You may or may not need to read the entire thing to be convinced that index funds are the best bet. However, Solin himself says several times throughout the book to go ahead and skip to Chapter 36 as soon as you’ve internalized that message. That’s where you’ll find the step-by-step instructions for picking the best funds for you.\n\nFor Intermediate Investors\n\nThe Automatic Millionaire\n\nby David Bach\n\nFor anyone interested in automating their finances\n\nContent: There’s more to David Bach than just “the latté factor.” The system he recommends here is excellent — an automated approach to managing your personal finances. If you’ve been meaning to open a Roth IRA but have never actually done so, then read this book! He’ll explain how to set it up so that it’s painless.\n\nThe Automatic Millionaire is based on sound financial concepts. The author encourages readers to eliminate debt, to live frugally, and to pay themselves first. But the core of his book is unique: Rather than develop willpower and self-discipline, Bach’s thought is, why not bypass the human element altogether? Why not make your path to wealth automatic?\n\nApplause: If you have your personal finances in order, you probably don’t need to read “The Automatic Millionaire.” But if you’re struggling to gain control, this book can make a big difference.\n\nCriticism: The only caveat I’d note is that this book is several years old now, and because it contains specific recommendations for financial companies, it may be in need of an update.\n\nThe Four Pillars of Investing\n\nby William Bernstein\n\nIntermediate investors\n\nComprehensive, holistic approach to investing\n\nContent: Most investing manuals espouse one sure-fire method or another. Four Pillars of Investing does that to an extent, but the author provides a great deal of depth and color to support his argument. I love that Bernstein takes a comprehensive, holistic approach to the subject, not just looking at the theory and business of investing, but also looking at the history and psychology of investing.\n\nApplause: This is a great book for anyone that wants to self-educate on investing.\n\nCriticism: The history section may be a bit of a slog for some readers. (From a review on Amazon.com: The new edition is essentially a reprint of the 2002 edition with a short commentary on the Great Recession.)\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nThe Only Investment Guide You’ll Ever Need\n\nby Andrew Tobias\n\nFor anyone interested in investing\n\nContent: Andrew Tobias is an entertaining writer. His jocular, conversational tone will keep you interested as he describes mutual funds, bonds, and treasury bills. There’s a good section on how to handle a windfall (lottery, inheritance).\n\nMy favorite bit from Tobias is his three-step budget: Destroy your credit cards, invest 20 percent of everything you earn (and never touch it), and live on the remaining 80 percent no matter what. Awesome.\n\nApplause/Criticism: This is a classic introduction to the subject of investing, though at times it seems a little dated.\n\nThe Bogleheads’ Guide to Investing\n\nby Larimore, Lindauer, and LeBoeuf\n\nFor anyone interested in investing\n\nContent: You want expert investment advice? You can’t beat the info found here. These devotees of Vanguard founder John Bogle are big on slow, sure investments like indexed mutual funds. They tap their decades of experience to teach about diversification, inflation, and asset allocation. This book covers a broad range of topics, though its primary focus is investing.\n\nApplause: Not nearly as boring as it sounds. Highly recommended.\n\nCriticism: It sticks pretty much to the notion that index funds are the best choice and could have done a better job of teaching how to decide which is the best choice.\n\n4th Stage: Financial Independence\n\nReaching financial independence\n\nReturn to main sections\n\nReaching Financial Independence\n\nThis penultimate section includes volumes covering topics related to financial independence — that magical point where you no longer have to work. This is the final stage of money management. For many people, this means retirement. But it doesn’t have to be that way. These books offer solid advice for how to create a future that matches your dreams.\n\nEarly Retirement Extreme\n\nby Jacob Lund Fisker\n\nFor engineers\n\nAnyone who wants to retire by cutting costs drastically\n\nContent: Imagine a personal finance book written by a theoretical physicist. What would it be like? Full of formulas and figures, right? Well, that’s what you get with “Early Retirement Extreme.” But you get more, too.\n\nThis is more than just a personal finance book filled with formulas and figures. It’s also philosophical. This book is about strategies, not tactics — it’s about the big picture instead of the day-to-day actions needed to retire early. If you’re up to the challenge of filling in Fisker’s framework with your own details, this book could be a life-changer.\n\nWhile many people think you need to earn big bucks to retire early, Fisker did it differently. Instead of boosting income, Fisker cut costs drastically. While drawing an average salary, he learned to live on less. Much less. He started to do things himself. His pre-retirement lifestyle and post-retirement lifestyle are essentially the same. Except now he doesn’t have to work.\n\nApplause/Criticism: Early Retirement Extreme feels like a book written by an engineer for other engineers. This isn’t a bad thing, but it is unique. Some people will love it; others will hate it. But if you’re up to the challenge of filling in Fisker’s framework with your own details, this book could be a life-changer.\n\nThe Quiet Millionaire\n\nby Brett Wilder\n\nFor those who are out of debt and building wealth\n\nContent: “The Quiet Millionaire” is a quiet book. Wilder isn’t bombastic and he doesn’t tout any gimmicks. It’s not really a book for beginners. It’s targeted at folks who have reached the third stage of personal finance — or beyond.\n\nApplause/Criticism: In many ways, “The Quiet Millionaire“ is boring. It’s like a textbook for financial independence. But you know what? Smart personal finance is boring too. Smart personal finance isn’t about being flashy or gambling in the stock market. Smart personal finance is about making the right choices day after day, year after year. “The Quiet Millionaire” may not make any best-seller lists, but I’ll bet it makes some of its readers rich.\n\nWork Less, Live More: The Way to Semi-Retirement\n\nby Bob Clyatt\n\nThose seeking alternatives to traditional retirement\n\nContent: Clyatt describes techniques for leaving the workaday world years (or decades) before the traditional retirement age of 65. “Work Less, Live More” includes sections on defining your goals, learning to live on less, putting your investments on autopilot, and more.\n\nThis book is like a toned-down, practical version of “The 4-Hour Workweek.”\n\nApplause/Criticism: Although this is applicable to all readers, high-income earners will find this material easier to apply.\n\nYes, You Can … Achieve Financial Independence\n\nby James Stowers\n\nAnyone interested in achieving financial independence\n\nContent: The book is filled with investment advice, but it gives equal time to thrift and savings. Best of all, it asks as many questions as it provides answers. It prompts the reader to think, to evaluate her priorities. Its message is that yes, you can achieve financial independence; but you can’t get there overnight, and you can’t get there without setting goals and making sacrifices.\n\nApplause: “Yes, You Can … Achieve Financial Independence” is informative without being dense. It’s accessible without being condescending. Its advice is solid.\n\nCriticism: I didn’t find much to criticize about this book, and nor is there much criticism on Amazon.com – so there you have it!\n\nKids and Money\n\nKids and money\n\nReturn to main sections\n\nKids and Money\n\nMany parents are unprepared to teach their children about money. You needn’t be one of them. These books suggest methods for getting kids to understand how money works.\n\nRaising Financially Confident Kids\n\nby Mary Hunt\n\nFor parents\n\nContent: This book provides a financial plan for your kids. Touching on debt, saving money, giving money, its goal is to help you teach your children how to handle money responsibly.\n\nApplause: The book is practical and covers preschool-aged children to teenagers. So, if you haven’t started your child’s financial education as soon as you’d have liked, Hunt gives you tips on how to talk to your kid — no matter what age they are!\n\nCriticism: If you are looking for a book about investing or entrepreneurship for kids, there are others that are better. This book is kind of like “The Tightwad Gazette” for kids.\n\nWhat Color is Your Piggy Bank?\n\nby Adelia Cellini Linecker\n\nKids from 10 to 14\n\nBudding entrepreneurs\n\nContent: Linecker covers the world of jobs, setting up shop, and how to manage money.\n\nGrowing Money: A Complete Investing Guide for Kids\n\nby Gail Karlitz\n\nKids ready to consider how to build wealth\n\nContent: Growing Money has good chapters on banks and bonds, but most of the book is devoted to stocks. The book also contains chapters on the history of the stock market, how investors make money, and how to buy and sell stocks.\n\nApplause/Criticism: This is probably my favorite book for children, but it does have some weak spots. Only one page out of 120 is devoted to mutual funds. Because the book is aimed at children, taxes are barely considered. Still, its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. It’s the sort of book to buy for your nephew, but read yourself before you pass it on.\n\nYou Call the Shots\n\nby Cameron Johnson\n\nYoung entrepreneurs\n\nContent: This book was written by a young entrepreneur.\n\nApplause: Flexo at Consumerism Commentary wrote: “This book should be required reading for any young adult showing an interest in entrepreneurship.”\n\nCriticism: But the criticism on Amazon.com listed the inexperience of a young entrepreneur as a negative.\n\nLiving Simply with Children\n\nby Marie Sherlock\n\nFor parents\n\nContent: Sherlock offers tips for how to raise children that aren’t part of the consumerist culture. She encourages strong family ties as a counter to the relentless purchase to acquire stuff. Sherlock is also a proponent of using family rituals to replace consumer-oriented cultural activities.\n\nApplause: There’s some great advice here (the book is strongly influenced by “Your Money or Your Life”).\n\nCriticism: Some readers may be put off by the author’s philosophy.\n\nThe Wealthy Barber\n\nby David Chilton\n\nFor beginners\n\nNovel format\n\nGreat for teenagers\n\nContent: This book offers good, general personal finance advice in the guise of a novel. Several friends meet once a month at the barber shop where the titular character dispenses wisdom on saving, investing, buying a house, and so on.\n\nApplause: The advice here is excellent, often backed by clear examples. The book’s conversational tone may appeal to some who might otherwise be turned off by personal finance.\n\nCriticism: While the conversational tone is a novel approach, some people may get impatient with it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThough we’ve linked to the Amazon pages for many of these books, we encourage you to get them free from your public library. J.D. Roth used to acquire the books in his personal finance library on the cheap from garage sales and thrift stores.\n\nI’m sure I’ve left out a book or two. Please feel free to add your favorites to our list!\n\n[Editorial note: We updated this article about the list of 25 books in J.D. Roth’s personal finance library, adding quite a number of other noteworthy books.

It is is easy to flip through it and be intimidated by all the charts and graphs.  Don’t be.  The book is written for the average person to understand.  Admittedly, I majored in math, but I really didn’t see anything in there that used any esoteric formulas.  If you are comfortable with ratios (one number divided by another) then you have all the mathematical acumen necessary to read RWDWS.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMike Witt says\n\t\t\t\t07 March 2007 at 10:56\n\nFor investing, I agree with the Boglehead’s guide and the Andrew Tobias book.  I didn’t find the Tobias book very practical (except for obvious things NOT to do) but it was very entertaining.\n\nAlso would suggest:\n\nBeat the Street – Peter Lynch.  Very funny, much like Tobias’ book.\n\nThe Five Rules for successful stock investing: Morningstar’s guide.  Goes into detail about valuation of individual company stocks.\n\nThe following three books all discuss various aspects of asset allocation (growth vs. value, sm-cap vs. large, diversification etc)\n\nWhat Works on Wall Street – James O’Shaughnesssy.  \n\nStocks for the Long Run – Jeremy Siegel (or anything by Jeremy Siegel)\n\nThe Intelligent Asset Allocator – William Bernstein\n\nI would also highly recommend going to http://www.morningstar.com and look for their Education section.  They have fantastic set of “courses” on stocks, funds, bonds and portfolios.  Each has maybe 50 short topics with a quiz.  Will take days or weeks to get through it, but it covers every aspect of investing.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMick says\n\t\t\t\t26 October 2011 at 22:55\n\nThe main article has some great reads, but in my opinion this reply has some gems in it and should be included in the main list.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAmelia says\n\t\t\t\t07 March 2007 at 11:13\n\nI have been looking for a list like this.

The only book I thought was missing was “Rich Dad, Poor Dad”\n\nI also would have liked to have seen a book about real estate investing.  Can anyone recommend one?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\ttraineeinvestor says\n\t\t\t\t07 March 2007 at 17:28\n\nA great list (and one that includes a few books I have yet to read).\n\nA couple of comments:\n\n1. you have listed some great books on investing and others have suggested a few more. However none of these focus on real estate and I would suggest adding a few books on this subject. I can recommedn a few but as these are often counrty specific and I do not live in the US, my recommendations may not be that relevant to most of you;\n\n2. some books on historical events (such as “The Great Crash” J K Galbraith, “Anatomy of the Bear” Russell Napier are good although a bit dry). If nothing else they will remind people that markets do not always go up and that the best time to invest is when there is “blood on the street”.\n\nSorry, but I disagree very strongly with the suggestion of adding “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” to the list. Like the writings of many self proclaimed gurus it may be motivational to the inexperienced and naive, but there is nothing else that is positive about that book.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tdonny says\n\t\t\t\t07 March 2007 at 18:11\n\nSecond on the thumbs down on “Rich Dad, Poor Dad”, Sorry, it’s pure snake oil.\n\nPlus would love to see a follow up post on real estate books. If I was to add one would be “Rental Houses for the Successful Small Investor”. One of the best buy and hold books I have ever read.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tli says\n\t\t\t\t07 March 2007 at 18:31\n\nWell you definitely missed two others:  “The Coffeehouse Investor” and “The Informed Investor”\n\nCoffeehouse provides a clear, easy to read and understand discussion of modern portfolio theory, asset allocation, risk management, index investing, and general market psychology.  It’s actually a fun, hip read. \n\nI view Informed as the technical companion to Coffeehouse. It’s denser, and clearly illustrates how / why modern portfolio theory works, and how risk is mitigated with the various asset allocation while maximizing gains.\n\nI’ve read many of the books cited and they are good.  But when you’re ready to invest, make sure you read these two, starting with Coffeehouse.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAlex says\n\t\t\t\t07 March 2007 at 20:22\n\nI personally have the Intelligent investor, i would say it’s not that technical after all. \n\nIf you could find that to understand some of the term on the book. This is a must read for all of those who want to invest on stock market. A classic i would say.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMichael Flessas says\n\t\t\t\t08 March 2007 at 01:58\n\nAdd the following books to the list: Security Analysis by Dr. Benjamin Graham, The Essays of Warren Buffett by Lawrence A. Cunningham, Buffettology by Mary Buffett, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Philip A. Fisher, Damodaran on Valuation by Dr. Aswath Damodaran, and Theory of Investment Value by John Burr Williams. Intelligent Investor, as noted by others, is a must read as well.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCarter Adler says\n\t\t\t\t08 March 2007 at 03:44\n\nI agree with Alex; The Intelligent Investor is not really that technical, though it is a bit massive. If you have trouble with it, try reading the stock articles in Morningstar’s free Investor University — they do a nice job of cutting through the (now-historical) numbers to the basic concepts, which are not that difficult to understand.\n\nFor traineeinvestor and others looking for a historical perspective, I highly recommend “Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation” by Edward Chancellor. While many historical books focus on the last 70 to 100 years of US markets, Chancellor covers bubble markets beginning with speculation in ancient Rome. He covers Holland’s tulipomania in the 1630s, London stockjobbers in the 1700s, the South Sea bubble in the 1720s (which lead Isaac Newton to comment “…I can predict the motion of planets and stars but not the madness of men…”), the British railway bubble in the 1840s, junk bonds and the Japanese bubble in the 1980s, and Long Term Capital Management and the internet in the 1990s, and many more periods of speculative frenzy.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMarc says\n\t\t\t\t08 March 2007 at 06:22\n\n“What is the first book that I should read that tells me how to invest?” These are easy to answer.\n\nSo, uh, what’s the first book that I should read that tells me how to invest?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tGlenn says\n\t\t\t\t08 March 2007 at 06:50\n\nJD Great list!

It sounds as if I need to give Random Walk and Intelligent Investor closer examination. I’ll put them in my to-read queue (which is quite long, by the way).\n\n@Marc\n\nThe first book that you should read that tells you how to invest depends on you and your situation. When somebody asks me that question, I try to learn a little more about them. I generally recommend Andrew Tobias as a good introduction, though anyone who’s serious about investing will want to find additional reading. But if a person’s more technically-minded, I steer them to Bogleheads.\n\nre: Rich Dad, Poor Dad\n\nI’m not a fan of this book. I recognize that it’s motivational (and, in fact, it was one of the books responsible for getting me to think about money), but I don’t think it has many actionable items in it. That is, there’s not a lot of stuff in RDPD that a person can use in their lives. I think of it and Loral Lagnemeier’s books as being less useful for specifics, but more useful for changing attitudes about money. But in that regard, I think the Eker book is superior. He’s more directly motivational, and when he does mention personal finance, his advice is sound.\n\nKeep the suggestions coming!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tGG says\n\t\t\t\t08 March 2007 at 07:55\n\nI have read most of the books on this list and think it is a very good starting point.\n\nI agree with previous posts that Your Money or Your Life by Dominguez and Robbins should be marked with two stars.\n\nProbably the next best finance book (and surprisingly omitted), is The Intelligent Asset Allocator – William Bernstein.\n\nI view Rich Dad Poor Dad as entertaining but not as essential or even useful reading. \n\nI think Intelligent Investor is a great book and definitely a classic. But, I think it is overly intimidating to people until they already have a substantial finance background.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTom says\n\t\t\t\t08 March 2007 at 10:02\n\nI completely disagree with having the “how to live without a car” book in this list.  I looked it over last weekend and it is completely devoid of content.  I can summarize the entire book: “don’t buy a car? take public transportation, or bike, or buy a motorcycle.  If it works for you, it works for you.  If it doesn’t, it doesn’t.  Oh, and here’s some poorly drawn pictures of people riding bikes on nice paths outside of polluted cities and we’ll up the font size to 17 so you can read it and now it’s 20 pages longer.”\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDavid K. says\n\t\t\t\t08 March 2007 at 10:14\n\nI would have to comment on “The Millionaire Next Door”.  I found it to be excessively pro-frugal as a method of accumulating wealth.  I found his second book “The Millionaire Mind” to be much more enjoyable as it emphasizes overall lifestyle and the possibility of accumulating wealth and simultaneously enjoying it.  \n\nI also began with “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” but would now echo the thumbs-down.  I enjoyed John T. Reed’s critique of RDPD.\n\nGood list.  Many I haven’t read.

Women live significantly longer than men – up to 20% longer – and need to plan thusly.\n\n2. Women move in and out of the workforce as a result of commitments to child- and parent-care, which are shouldered more often by men than women.\n\n3. Divorce leaves most women with a reduced standard of living, and 1 in 3 marriages now end in divorce.\n\nJoanne addresses all these things with aplomb, and offers all kinds of other sage advice about tending and protecting your money and your life. Also, she’s funny and ballsy, both of which I appreciated.\n\nDavid Bach’s “Smart Women Finish Rich” is great, too, even though all the TM’d phrases are a little annoying.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAnissa says\n\t\t\t\t10 March 2007 at 20:04\n\nI suggest:\n\nThe Money Camp – a financial literacy at home program for kids.

We are moving towards a hyper-inflation which means that the $20,000 that you worked so hard to save over the last several years will be lose much of its value in the years ahead.\n\nThe alternative to saving your money would be to invest in tangible assets that hedge against inflation like gold, silver and oil.\n\nLeveraging debt is one way to increase wealth. If you are looking to make large sums of wealth, you MUST leverage debt and not be afraid of it.\n\nAcquiring wealth first begins with an abundance mindset. If you are obsessed with living below your means, it will be difficult to focus on expanding your means and tapping into the abundant resources that we have available to us.\n\nI’ve learned all of this from my mentor Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad.

They will not tell you how to ‘get rich’ quickly, and some of their advice is very counter-intuitive for someone raised to spend more time focusing on small details rather than big picture financial issues.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tbutter says\n\t\t\t\t05 September 2008 at 08:50\n\nYour Money or Your Life    this book rocks\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSuze says\n\t\t\t\t05 September 2008 at 16:45\n\n“The Tightwad Gazette” is a book that really blew my already thrifty mind, so I was glad to see it listed above. The woman is sheer Yankee genius. I would consider it a more advanced course for those who have already embraced the basic thrifty concepts, but if you need some new ideas, look here. She is especially good about saving $ on food, I think. Unfortunately she has stopped writing but the book is aging well. I have given it to two people who said they read it cover to cover and that it had a substantial impact on their spending. –suze\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tChristine Groth says\n\t\t\t\t15 October 2008 at 09:44\n\nHere is another great money book, that was just published.  \n\n101 Ways to Magnetize Money by Matt Furey\n\nGo to :  http://www.101WaystoMagnetizeMoney.com\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tVitali Komarov, artist says\n\t\t\t\t21 October 2008 at 04:31\n\nMy favorite book is “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” by Stephen Covey. Very simple and effective tips how to improve and  change yourself and this way to reach the goals.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tEnzo says\n\t\t\t\t26 October 2008 at 00:41\n\nCan we all agree by now that those books are full of s? Hmm, let’s see, S&amp;P 500 is down 40% since 1998. That’s 10 years of investing your hard earned money down the toilet. I’m not even considering inflation, fees, etc. Then you might come with the mantras, “diversify, dollar cost average…” Ok, the Nikkei Index is down 78%, which means 20 years of investing in the Pacific down the toilet. Korea is bankrupt. Could you people at least burn the above books? Let me guess, you’re all voting for Obama, right? Wall Street, politicians, and book writers love people like you.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJeremy says\n\t\t\t\t05 November 2008 at 06:27\n\nVery good list, and nice adds in the comments section!\n\nFor the comments on Rich Dad, Poor Dad – he’s a very good salesman, and he’s selling your own ability to reach financial freedom. Too light on actual useful techniques, and he makes it sound too easy, but there are some good ideas there. My favorite is his definition of wealth: how many months you could continue with your current lifestyle if you lost your job now. Thus infinite wealth is streams of passive income in excess of your expenses. Financial Freedom.\n\nBooks I would add to the list:\n\nSafe Strategies for Financial Freedom by Van K Tharp. What RDPD should be – he completely sells you on Financial Freedom in the beginning, then gets into cutting debt, increasing cashflow, re-deploying the assets you have, different investments, and finally risk management. When I finished investments, I was a little let-down that there wasn’t more with so much of the book left, but the risk understanding is the best part of the book, especially when he gets to taking responsibility for your situation.\n\nCreating Wealth by Robert Allen. My favorite Robert Allen book, because he starts with a list of asset classes and breaks down their strong and weak points – worth it just for this chart! But he also gets into how to accelerate your real estate portfolio, and some very clever ideas on how to build wealth with mortgages and other less-well-known strategies. You can get in trouble with “No money down” strategies, but overall a very good book.\n\nIt’s Not About the Money by Brent Kessel. This and T Harv Eker’s book are the best I’ve found on understanding and re-wiring your relationship to money. When he comes to financial crises, he starts with Loving-Kindness meditation and some very good non-standard practices.\n\nAutomatic Wealth: The 6 Steps to Financial Independence by Michael Masterson. Master marketer and businessperson, he walks you through the stages (if not full steps) of getting rich – starting with becoming indispensable at work, then building your own side business. I didn’t like Ready, Fire, Aim as much though – this one is better overall.\n\nJust One Thing by John Mauldin. He goes to some of the best minds in investing, and asks, “If you could impart just one idea to your family/disciple/students about money, what would it be?” There are some great answers here.\n\nMarket Wizards by Jack Schwager. More for people who actively invest or trade the markets, this book looks at the most successful and what they do. You’ll find some common themes: cautiously optimistic, willing to be responsible for their mistakes, honest appraisals about their abilities, understanding of risks, and great money management (best explained in Tharp’s book – the first on my list).\n\nGood reading!

While starting up my business and developing my own finance library, I stumbled upon this gem:\n\nMillionaireManager.com\n\nThis book is hilarious–well-written in a simple, conversational style. Even a fifth grader could understand this…and that is not at all an insult to the book, which underscores the importance of getting a true grasp on your business’ financial fortitude.\n\nEvidently, even businesses that are showing up making a profit are still losing money! Could that be why we are in such an economic mess? Maybe.\n\nStill, one should absolutely check this book out–a finance library Must-Have!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tOlivier says\n\t\t\t\t17 December 2008 at 03:49\n\nHello,\n\nThanks for this list.

He’s published many books. My personal favorite is “Ordinary People, Extraordinary Wealth”. If, after reading the first chapter, you should chose to continue to pre-pay your mortgage, at least you’ll know why you’re doing it. And if you’re not pre-paying, you’ll know why that may be an excellent financial decision.\n\nP.S. I wholeheartedly agree with the omission of RDPD.

Roth\n\n|\n\nPublished: 09 January 2019 – Updated: 15 October 2024\n\n|\n\n54 comments\n\n\t766\n\tshares\n\n\t760\n\n\t6\n\nIf you’ve read money blogs over the past five years, you’ve heard about Personal Capital. Personal Capital is a free money-tracking tool with a beautiful interface and — gasp — no advertising. (One of my big complains about Mint is that it shoves ads in your face.)\n\nMany of my friends and colleagues promote the hell out of Personal Capital because the company pays good money when people sign up. (And yes, links to Personal Capital in this review absolutely put money in my pocket. But any Personal Capital link you see anywhere on the web puts money in somebody’s pocket.)\n\nI sometimes wonder, though, if any of my pals actually uses Personal Capital, you know? All of their reviews are glowing. While I like Personal Capital, I’ve been frustrated by the app in the past. Even today, I find that it’s not as useful as I’d like.\n\nWhat are my issues with Personal Capital?\n\nFor a long time, I was frustrated trying to get Personal Capital to connect to my accounts. It still won’t connect to my credit union, but that’s fine. I can enter my balance manually. It was frustrating, though, that for years I couldn’t get Personal Capital to connect to my Fidelity investment accounts. They work now…but I’m always worried that they won’t. The app still won’t connect to my Capital One credit card — and hasn’t for over a year, which I find mind-blowing.\n\nPersonal Capital, as an investment app, isn’t robust enough to replace something like Quicken or You Need a Budget. The latter tools allow you to track and manage your money on a transaction by transaction level. Okay, maybe you can track your transactions, but you can’t do anything meaningful with them, the same way you could with Quicken or YNAB.\n\nThe phone calls! My god, the phone calls! Here’s a not-so-secret secret: The Personal Capital app — while beautiful and useful — is actually bait. It’s a lure. Its aim is to attract high net-worth users to connect their accounts. When they do, Personal Capital (the company) begins a phone campaign in an attempt to recruit the users as clients. Personal Capital isn’t actually an app company; it’s a wealth-management company. They want people with lots of money to sign up. (I can’t comment on whether this is a good deal or not. I don’t want a financial advisor. I ignore all of the calls from Personal Capital.)\n\nPersonal Capital has pretty reports, but there aren’t enough of them. My copy of Quicken 2007 — ugly as it is — has 23 different reports and 10 different graphs. (Plus, you can customize many more.) Personal Capital has maybe…nine ways to look at your money? (I can’t tell for sure.)\n\nThe security is over the top. I suppose I should be happy about this, but I’m not. It feels like I’m constantly having to verify my identity via email or text message. Some of my other accounts make me do this occasionally, but it feels like Personal Capital does this multiple times per week. That’s crazy!\n\nNow, these complaints aside, here’s a confession: I’ve been using the Personal Capital app for 5+ years. For real. I can’t remember when I started, but I do remember being cranky because a Personal Capital rep didn’t know who I was at Fincon in St. Louis. “I use your app,” I told him. “And I have a big blog.” (I wince now at the thought of my arrogance.)\n\nDespite the drawbacks, there must be something to it. Right? Today — using my current financial situation — let’s look at the pros and cons of Personal Capital.\n\nQuicken 2007 vs. Personal Capital\n\nAs regular readers know, I’m an old fogey. My money management tool of choice is an antiquated copy of Quicken for Mac 2007. This tool is so important to me, in fact, that I’m currently refusing to update my system software to the latest version (Mac OS Mojave) because I’m afraid it’ll break Quicken. (Other user experiences are mixed.) How important is Quicken 2007 to me? No joke: I would buy a used Mac laptop just to run that software.\n\nAs much as I love Quicken, it has its drawbacks. One of those is that it’s a pre-mobile app. Quicken 2007 is almost as old as this blog. It came out roughly one year before the first iPhone. (Get Rich Slowly launched on 15 April 2006. I can’t find a release date for Quicken 2007, but it was available by at least 30 August 2006. The iPhone launched on 29 June 2007.) If I want to interact with Quicken, I have to sit down at my desktop computer.\n\nBecause I’m a nerd, I’m attached to my mobile devices. I have an iPad. And an iPhone. And an Apple Watch. (Why isn’t it an iWatch? I don’t know. Apple doesn’t give a fig about consistency.) I want to be able to track my money from my mobile devices.\n\nTrust me: I’ve tried tons of other mobile apps. I don’t really like any of them. I do, however, like Personal Capital…warts and all. I would never ever use it as my only money management tool, but as one piece of a bigger package, it’a actually kind of awesome.\n\nPersonal Capital is the only mobile money management app that I use. There are others out there, sure, but for my needs, Personal Capital fills a niche…and fills it well.\n\nPersonal Capital as Daily Money Tracker\n\nI use Personal Capital as a daily tracker. Quicken 2007 is my actual go-to tool for entering and analyzing my data, but Personal Capital is what I’ve used for the past five years to check on my accounts to make sure everything is okay.\n\nBelieve it or not, Personal Capital has saved my bacon several times. What? My credit card payment is due today? Whoops! I’d better go pay it. Wait! What’s this strange charge on my account? That’s not me. Let me call my bank. Whoa! I forgot to pay my garbage bill. I’d better handle that when I get home.\n\nBecause Personal Capital connects to (most of) my accounts, I’m able to look at everything from a unified dashboard. I don’t have to log in to each credit card and bank account to verify everything. I can do it from one place. (Okay, not my credit union. I still have to go check that separately.)\n\nHere, for instance, is a look at my recent transactions. (I have no idea what the graph is tracking. I’m not sure I care.)\n\nWhen I shared my financial situation recently, a few readers wondered why I don’t count my business finances when tracking my entire money picture. Well, in Personal Capital I do. Because I can connect the app to both personal and business accounts, I can get an idea of the Big Picture. Here you can see that most of my expenses for January so far have been blog related.\n\nI’ll admit, it’s very nice to have a single app where I can view all of my recent transactions, both personal and business. Although I only take action on this info maybe twice per year, it sets my mind at ease. It takes thirty seconds of my time each day, but that’s thirty seconds I’m happy to spend.\n\nPersonal Capital as Investment Tracker\n\nHonestly, though, Personal Capital isn’t meant to be a daily money-management tool. For that, I’d use something like You Need a Budget. Personal Capital is specifically designed to monitor your investments. Because of this, the Personal Capital app has a variety of tools to help investors.\n\nFirst up, there’s the plain ol’ portfolio view:\n\nNothing special here, right? You get a list of your investments and a graph of their performance over the past 90 days. Nothing special, but still easier for me than logging into the Fidelity website (or app).\n\n(As a passive investor, though, I don’t actually look at investment performance that often. I might check it once per week…but a couple of times per month is more likely.)\n\nYou can also get a breakdown of your asset allocation:\n\nThe Personal Capital app also offers something interesting — something I think Vanguard and Fidelity should offer. They have a tool that analyzes the fees on your investment accounts. As you probably know, fees are one of the top drags on the average investor’s performance. Too many suckers pay 1% or 2% per year (or more!) in mutual fund costs. Index funds have risen to prominence because they promise management fees of 0.20% or 0.10% (or lower).\n\nPersonal Capital makes it clear just how much you’re paying in fees.\n\nIn my case, I’m doing fairly well except in my rollover IRA. But I’m okay with that. That rollover IRA is 100% invested in a real-estate investment trust (or REIT), and those carry higher expense ratios. (True story: That REIT is actually my highest performing investment over the past decade!)\n\nPersonal Capital’s Retirement Calculator\n\nAll of these other features are great, but there’s one main reason I continue to use Personal Capital: its retirement calculator.\n\nAs I mentioned the other day, I hate most retirement calculators. They’re overly simplistic. Their assumptions are bogus. They’re designed to get users to save more than they need.\n\nThe Personal Capital retirement calculator isn’t the best tool on the market — we’ll look at two better tools during the next week — but it’s pretty damn good for something that’s free and built into an otherwise useful app.\n\nThis section is going to be the biggest part of this review, and it’s going to contain plenty of screenshots. You’ve been warned.\n\nFirst up, here’s a look at my own personal financial situation as of this morning. (Sorry for the “mute” notification in the middle of the screenshot. My bad. Not sure why I was muting my iPad, but I can’t fix it now.)\n\nBased on my current situation — $736,170 in liquid investments and roughly $60,000 of annual expenses — Personal Capital says I’ll run out of money at 62. This doesn’t differ much from other retirement calculators I’ve looked at.\n\nBut here is where Personal Capital gets fun (and the reason I’m obsessed with it). Do you see those + signs across from Investment Events and Spending Goals? If you click on those, you can add new events. (And if you click on existing events, you can modify those.) This means you can tweak your parameters over and over and over again.\n\nWhat if, for instance, I decreased my spending from $60,000 per year to $42,000 per year? (This is my aim for 2019.)\n\nWell, look at that. If I re-embrace frugality, my money will likely last until I’m 72 instead of 62. Nice!\n\nAnd now that I’m back to work at the box factory, what if I stay there for ten years and earn $20,000 annually?\n\nHoly cats! As you can see, working part-time makes a ginormous difference. If I reduce my spending to $3500 per month while earning $20,000 per year, I’m golden. I shouldn’t run out of money before my projected age of demise. (Even in a “worst-case scenario”, my money would last until age 67.)\n\nAnd if I end up with an inheritance? Party time!\n\nOkay, maybe I’m getting a little too out of control there. Let’s dial things back. Let’s get rid of the inheritance and bring my spending back to current levels. If I work part-time for ten years, what then?\n\nHm. Not enough to get me to where I want to go, is it? (Plus, I was muting the sound again. What the heck?) Okay, what if I decide to sell this house at some point in the next ten years. What then?\n\nOkay, not bad. That makes me wonder, though, what if I did not decide to go back to work for the family business. What then?\n\nWell, I guess that’s not bad, but it’s not nearly as good as if I’m bringing in some sort of income.\n\nOkay, let’s look at the ultimate optimistic scenario. Let’s say I trim my spending from $60,000 per year to $42,000 per year. Let’s assume I spend the next decade at the box factory earning $20,000 per year. Let’s assume that my mother dies in ten years or so and leaves me an inheritance. Let’s assume that Kim and I sell this place after increasing frustration with the never-ending repairs, then move into a rented apartment.\n\nAfter all those assumptions, what does my future look like?\n\nBut that’s a future that’s far too rosy than the one I think lies ahead.\n\nYou get the point, though. Even without the app’s other features, I’d love Personal Capital just for its retirement calculator. It’s more fun and flexible than 95% of the other retirement calculators on the market. (As I mentioned, we’ll take a peek at the 5% that are better over the next few days.)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI have been using Personal Capital for five years now. It’s nowhere near a complete money-management tool, and I know that. But I don’t care. I don’t expect it to be the biggest and bestest. I accept it for what it is.\n\nPersonal Capital is great at a few things:\n\nMonitoring your money on a daily basis.\n\nTracking (and analyzing) your investment portfolio.\n\nPlaying with various retirement scenarios.\n\nIf you’re not interested in these three tasks, Personal Capital probably isn’t right for you. If you want a lot of detail and analysis, Personal Capital probably isn’t right for you. If you have a lot of money invested and don’t want people to pester you with phone calls, Personal Capital probably isn’t right for you.\n\nFor everyone else, though, Personal Capital is a useful (if imperfect) tool. If you decide to use it, just be aware of its limitations. As I say, I’ve been using it for five years. It’s not my top tool, but it’s the one I access most often. That’s worth something, I guess.\n\nI’m curious, though. Many GRS readers must also be using Personal Capital. What are your experiences like? Do you recommend it? What are your favorite features? What do you not like? Would you recommend Personal Capital to a friend?\n\n\t766\n\tshares\n\n\t760\n\n\t6\n\nMore about...Apps\n\nJ.D.

I then moved to Quicken when Money stopped being supported. For a while I used nothing but over the last few years have looked into what is available.\n\nI’m in Australia so a lot of the popular money management programs don’t sync to our bank accounts and, after years of having to upload data into Money and Quicken, if it doesn’t sync automatically, I’m not using it.\n\nI’ve been using a program called Pocketsmith which is more Australia / New Zealand centric and works well, but the reporting is still a bit limited.\n\nI’m interested in the calculators – simple but effective.\n\nThe problem I have with most of these programs is that they’re good at telling you where you’ve spent your money, but they’re not great at helping you plan for the future by looking at your future spending and using elements of gamification to encourage better spending habits.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAlena says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 00:00\n\nLike Allan, I’d be really interested in an App that connects to my accounts, tracks my spending, motivates me to review some items and gives me a good retirement forecast. Alas, haven’t found one yet – personal capital is also not available in germany. For now, I download my transactions to Excel once in a while and otherwise work with automated savings – so old-school!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJB says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 00:34\n\nI still use Microsoft Money to this day. Yes, it’s not supported by Microsoft any more, but it’s free, there are a bunch of us who still use it and some smart folks have figured out ways to patch some of the problems with it (including how to make it work on Windows 10). When it finally stops working on some future version of Windows, I’ll keep using it on Windows 7 or 10 inside a Parallels Virtual Machine.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tRoss says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 06:14\n\nYou nailed it.  I recommend PC to friends with the same caveats.  My situation is very similar to yours, Quicken for the detailed stuff and PC for the easy daily snapshots and retirement calculator.  PC could add 3 things that would make me drop quicken though…  a Projected Balances view that lets me enter paychecks and bills and makes sure I won’t overdraft, more flexible categorization of expenses, and the ability to manually change dates to avoid the weird spikes that happen when transfers between accounts aren’t instantaneous.\n\nUntil then, I keep updating Quicken every 3 years so I can keep the auto-download alive.   I’ve been dreading the switch to the subscription model, so I’m holding on to Q2017 as long as I can.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSmileIfYouDare says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 07:28\n\nThe significant reason I don’t us Personal Capital is the total disaster that would happen if they were hacked.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLarry Ludwig says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 08:45\n\nWhat would happen if they were hacked…nothing.\n\nThey don’t have write access to your data and with two factor enabled (which you should do) for each account would make it impossible (ok very highly unlikely) to get access. \n\nI would say there are easier targets based upon what info they will get directly through their site. As no account data is shown, and can’t perform transactions.\n\nThe hackers could glam info of your purchasing habits and specific things you buy.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSteve says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 10:41\n\nI am 100% sure they are storing passwords encrypted. However, if they get hacked hard enough, the encryption key(s) could be extracted along with the encrypted passwords.\n\nNot every brokerage / bank even has two factor authentication. Some of those that do, implement it in such a way that it would block aggregators like Personal Capital from accessing the data.\n\nLike SmileIfYouDare, this is the reason I refuse to use Personal Capital. I will start using it when every financial institution allows me to set up special read-only credentials for aggregators.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPhysician on FIRE says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 12:12\n\nPersonal Capital doesn’t store your login info.

Why do they go on and on about how many bits of encryption they use?\n\nTo me, PC’s statements on security are riddled with just enough inconsistencies and non-sequiturs that I fear it is more security theater than actual security.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tNancy says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 09:12\n\n“The phone calls!

Like you, I also use Quicken for the day to day bill paying, mainly because of the ability to see a forecast for where I expect to be in the next 30 days or so. If I could find a product to replace it I would, tried Mint and didn’t like it.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJason says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 09:27\n\nFor the Capital One connection issue, have you enabled third party access in your Capital One account? A lot of banks are doing that now, which is a hurdle but nice for security.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCalLadyQED says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 09:28\n\nAw, I saw the title and was thinking “human capital.” That would be an interesting article.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCalLadyQED says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 09:38\n\nI don’t use any apps. I put everything manually into a spreadsheet in Excel as I initiate transactions and tag each with “me”. Then when it shows up on my bank’s website, I tag it “ok.” Finally, when I review my monthly statement, I mark it “S.” \n\nI follow more or less this process for cash, 2 checking accounts, 2 savings accounts, 2 credit cards, 1 payment account, 1 investment account, 1 tax-advantaged health savings account, 1 tax-advantage limited-purpose flexible spending account (some years, but not this year), and gift cards. I do not include my 401k, but I could add it.\n\nI also include a worksheet where I track my income, withholdings, etc. from my job. \n\nI have grown this workbook for years now. I track my spending and income by categories that are meaningful to me. It’s manual and a bit tedious, but I’m using it and it seems to be helping me.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSome Old Guy says\n\t\t\t\t11 January 2019 at 06:06\n\nI do the same thing.  Yes, it is tedious to enter things manually (“the horror!”) but the other side of it is that taking a few minutes a couple times a week (I average 5 to 10 minutes every couple of days) to update my spreadsheet also makes me take a few minutes to think about what I am entering into it. Am I spending a bit too much? Are my investments going up or down? Should I put the money I have set aside for savings in my next paycheck into my actual savings account or shift it to my investment account or should I use it to cover some large bill?\n\nEase of use is nice, but if it leads to complacency (I think this is why a number of people with fairly high incomes are “living paycheck to paycheck”) I think I am better off doing things the old fashioned way.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tNW Nester says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 09:54\n\nHi JD, been a lurker for years and appreciate how personal you make personal finance.\n\nJust wanted to note that the reason the final picture looks so rosy is because you have the inheritance setup up as $300k per year for life instead of a one time event.\n\nSince I’m a natural spender/collector, your story resonates and I like how you dig into the details and share so much. Looking forward to following along.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.D. says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 10:04\n\nHaha. That’s hilarious. I was wondering why things looked so good. I didn’t catch that. I’ll go make an adjustment and amend the post.

I also moved about 1/3 of my assets to them when I began to realize I was paying high fees for mutual fund investments with my former financial planner. PC fees are 0.80% so that’s much cheaper than most mutual funds but more expensive than robo-advisors. When you invest with PC, you get some additional tools like multiple retirement scenarios and help with drawing down assets in retirement.\n\nMy bank used to have FinanceWorks and using that with PC investment tools was a great combination. Unfortunately, my bank suspended FinanceWorks and I haven’t replaced it with anything.\n\nFor the rest of my assets, I used the PC recommended asset allocation and bought cheap ETFs from some major sellers like iShares, SPDR, Schwab, and Vanguard. I use an Excel spreadsheet to monitor and rebalance as needed.\n\nLately though, I’ve become unhappy with PC financial planner because he can’t help me with several issues that I thought should be within their purview like Medicare. He’s more an investment advisor than a financial planner and I’m not happy with that.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tEileen says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 12:25\n\nJD — you know you planted a little seed with that “increasing frustration with the never-ending repairs”.   You’ve covered the house issues extensively, so I’m curious if this is truly “increasing” since the last update or just generally speaking. \n\nI just deleted 3 paras about our 1978 house and all we’ve done and still need to do.  Then I deleted them to just say:  It really does not end.\n\nAppreciate the detailed review of PC.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.D. says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 13:18\n\nThis is just generally speaking. We’re still wrestling with the leaky kitchen sink (it’s my weekend project). Plus, I just went out to the Mini Cooper and discovered it has a swamp inside. It’s sprung a roof leak. Ugh. Sometimes I hate the Oregon rain.

It looks ugly as a dog’s hind end, but it sure keeps off the rain and the snow. #singlehandedlybringingdownpropertyvalues\n\nWe don’t have a garage, and the only places to put it would cut off easy access to the back yard. Besides, this works just fine. I particularly appreciate not having to brush snow off the car before I drive it, and to be able to carry in bags of groceries in the pouring rain without getting soaked.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJC Webber III says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 14:53\n\nBetween YNAB and Vanguard, all my bases are covered.  I added all my non-Vanguard assets under ‘Outside Investments’.  Now Vanguard’s ‘Balance and Holdings’ page shows everything (except CCs).\n\nIn YNAB I put all my investment accounts under the ‘Off Budget’ section, so YNAB can display an accurate Net Worth report.  And it DOES know about my CCs.\n\n8^)\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tzzzzzz says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 16:36\n\nGiven how much you like Quicken, you might consider getting a cheap Windows computer for that.

Plus, they’ve moved to an SaaS (subscription-based) model. That’s bullshit. I paid maybe $40 for Quicken 2007 nearly thirteen years ago. That’s about $3/year. Now they want me to pay $35/year? Forget it.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tzzzzzz says\n\t\t\t\t11 January 2019 at 17:31\n\nI agree that $35/year is very expensive.  I wonder if the switch to the subscription model will kill it.  \n\nI was willing to pay about $30 every 3 or 4 years, but at $35/year or more, I’m going to stretch out the life of my current version (I think it’s 2014) as long as possible.  \n\nYou may still be able to get a copy of an earlier version of Quicken, from before they went to the subscription model.  I see 2017 available online, but I’m not sure if that’s pre-subscription.\n\n\t\t\t\tSequentialkady says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 16:40\n\nOne of the the frustrations I’ve been having with Mint is that it doesn’t talk to my Target CC and it’s increasingly glitchy with my main bank account and one of my CCs.  I was thinking of Personal Capital until reading your review.\n\nNot only is it glitchy, but they call you?!  Oh hell no.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTracy says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 16:57\n\nHi JD. Just had to chime in that I’m in a similar boat with quicken. I even bought a newer version two years ago thinking my Mac upgrade would render 2007 unusable (it didn’t, but I am behind a few) but what was unusable was new quicken. Quicken 2007 is a beast. The reports! Oh the reports! But I’ve been lazy, and I’m woefully out of sync in my updates. I’ve been using personal capital to track my credit cards/investments, but quicken for checking/cash accounts. I keep looking at the new quicken but now they want a subscription or some nonsense to stay updated. I’ll just keep rocking 2007 as long as I can.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCanTex says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 17:51\n\nSeveral things, First, the slick high-pressure calls were a turnoff. Also I was not about to give them my logon details for my investment accounts.  As I remember there was no way to do manual data entry. Lastly, they couldn’t hook up to my Canadian accounts.  Just bad vibes and uneasiness all around. Mistrust. After that bad experience I was so happy to continue with Quicken 2019.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSandi Kay says\n\t\t\t\t10 January 2019 at 22:08\n\nI have tried YNAB, and find it to be too much work.\n\nI have a Mac, so Quicken is a problem.\n\nI won’t add in my login details, so PC is not likely.\n\nSo, current options seems to be Money Dance and Buxfer.\n\n@JD – the review on Money Dance sounds like it’s made for you: “If you miss The Quicken of Old, Money Dance may be the next best thing. You’ll pay for the software, but it has a number of features. The display looks like a ledger, and you can automatically add recurring transactions, create charts and graphs to visually represent your spending, and project your finances into the future. Money Dance has a homepage that quickly summarizes your financial situation, including assets and liabilities, and your net worth.\n\nYou can also track your investments, and it allows for multiple currencies. Money Dance can also help you reconcile your bank statements. If you wish Quicken 2005 was still a thing, Money Dance is the app for you.\n\nBest for: Those still in mourning for the demise of Quicken 2005.”\n\n🙂\n\nRead more at: https://www.moneyunder30.com/best-budgeting-tools.”\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.D. says\n\t\t\t\t11 January 2019 at 08:24\n\nHaha.

And JD was SPOT ON with his comment about the sales calls. Within 5 minutes of downloading the app I received a call. I hadn’t even finished linking my accounts. Their first (and only) question was “how much money do you have invested outside of an employer 401k”? &gt;$100k they offer you a free consultation with one of their “experts”, &lt;$100k they tell you there's nothing they can do to help lol.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTim says\n\t\t\t\t01 June 2019 at 17:08\n\nI just quit Personal Capital today, and I couldn’t be happier about it. They have been unable to connect to my eTrade account for three (!!) weeks now, which is completely absurd. They put out a notice acknowledging the problem two weeks ago, but haven’t updated it since. An email to support was met with b a form letter response saying “we’ll let you know.” A second email to support was met with “sorry you didn’t like our first answer, but this stuff is hard.”\n\nNo, it isn’t. \n\nHow do I know? I signed up with Mint and it immediately connected to eTrade with zero problems. \n\nTwo other things I disliked: the constant notifications from Personal Capital to meet my financial advisor (which you were forced to read before you could use the app), and the SLOW updates to my account balances. Honestly I would tell the app to update and then waited an hour to see if it was done. \n\nPersonal Capital used to be good. Not anymore. I will use literally anything else.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPeter Newman says\n\t\t\t\t17 July 2019 at 21:35\n\nI used and loved Pc for several years, and then for some reason their software became unable to connect with my Fidelity 401k accounts.

Might be Fidelity’s fault though, as neither TIAA nor Quicken 2019 for MAC can sync Fidelity files anymore either.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tRoy Feague says\n\t\t\t\t01 June 2019 at 22:00\n\nWe like Personal Capital until one day it suddenly stopped downloading our transactions from our credit union.  That’s when we discovered that you simply can’t get support for Personal Capital, even if you offer to pay whatever fee or upgrade to whatever subscription level.  We opened a ticket on April 25th.  Since then, a support rep has periodically politely responded to say that she has no updates, but it’s clear that nobody is looking at our issue, and there’s nothing we can do.  We had come to rely on this tool, and suddenly it’s useless and there’s nothing we can do about it.  This is the problem with a “free” service.  You have no recourse, and can be left hanging at any time.  Financial information is too valuable to justify this.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tRay says\n\t\t\t\t06 September 2019 at 11:41\n\nThat is what I get also, however I would think they could figure out the bug with Fidelity.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tRay says\n\t\t\t\t02 September 2019 at 08:08\n\nI like Personal Capital much better than Mint, I find it easier to track to two different “goals”. It also allowed me to quickly and easily understand my allocation better since I am spread out over Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab and my companies 401K.\n\nMy question is @JD is how did you get Fidelity to work. It has not worked for me in a couple of months.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tRick says\n\t\t\t\t04 December 2019 at 19:53\n\nI think I’ve found a flaw in Personal Capital’s retirement planner.  I have my retirement spending set to equal my pension, part time income and SS income so I dont have to touch investments.  30 yrs from now at 7% annual increase, the investments should equal 3 times what Personal Capital calculates.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMr.Thomas says\n\t\t\t\t12 December 2019 at 11:03\n\nFor what’s it’s worth a greatly reduced the calls (and website nags) from Personal Capital by scheduling a consultation on the website for December 25, 2025 (some years ago).  I did still get the occasional call, but simply told them I wasn’t interested and didn’t want to be contacted anymore and I haven’t heard anything from them in awhile.  I do enjoy the overall view and tools that Personal Capital provides and the retirement planner has some interesting what if scenarios to play with.

Roth\n\n|\n\nPublished: 10 December 2020 – Updated: 13 October 2024\n\n|\n\n30 comments\n\n\t431\n\tshares\n\n\t428\n\n\t3\n\nAs the financial independence and early retirement movement (or FIRE movement, for short) has gained popularity, some myths and misconceptions have sprung up about what it entails. Too many people make assumptions about what the FIRE movement is and what it’s made of.\n\nA lot of folks think the FIRE movement is cult-ish. Some think that financial independence and early retirement are only for rich white people. (Or, more specifically, for white men in the tech industry.) Others say that early retirement is only possible with a high income. Or you can only do this if you’re so frugal it hurts. And, of course, there are was Paula Pant’s podcast episode, where we found out Suze Orman hates the FIRE movement because she believes you need millions in order to retire — early or otherwise.\n\nI’ll be honest. Each objection and complaint about financial independence contains a grain of truth. But each objection and complaint misses the point in some important ways.\n\nToday, let’s look at some of these myths and misconceptions about financial independence and early retirement, and explore why these myths and misconceptions are myths and misconceptions.\n\nWhat IS financial independence?\n\nBefore we dive in, here are the basics of FIRE for those who are unfamiliar.\n\nFinancial independence and early retirement are two terms for the same concept: You’ve saved enough money that — in theory – you shouldn’t ever have to work for income again…unless you want to. We talk about “financial independence” because too many people want to argue over the definition of retirement.\n\nRoughly speaking, you can consider yourself financially independent (and able to retire early) when your investments equal 25x your annual spending. There’s some nuance to this, but that’s a fine rule of thumb. So, if you spend $50,000 per year, you’ve achieved F.I. when you have $1.25 million in your investment accounts. If you spend $20,000 per year, you need $500,000 invested. If you spend $200,000 per year, you need $5,000,000.\n\nFinancial independence is achieved by creating a gap between your earning and spending. This gap — your saving rate — is the key to achieving all financial goals, especially early retirement. The larger your saving rate, the sooner you’ll build the life of your dreams.\n\nThat’s it. That’s all there is to it. It’s just math — plus hard work and patience.\n\nWhile researching this article, I found a October 2018 survey of the FIRE movement produced by TD Ameritrade. The Harris Poll talked to 1503 Americans about their money and about early retirement, then TD Ameritrade interpreted the results. This is the only systematic survey about FIRE that I know of, and I’m going to refer to it throughout this article.\n\nFinancial Independence Isn’t Possible with Kids\n\nThe most common misconception about FIRE is that it’s not possible if you have children. When I explain the idea to people I meet, this is often the first thing they say: “Well, that works great if you’re single, but it just won’t work if you have a family.”\n\nParenthood is an expensive proposition. The USDA estimates that it costs roughly $250,000 to raise a child — and that does not include college. Obviously, this means that if you have children and want to retire early (or achieve other financial goals), you’ll need to earn more money. But children don’t make financial independence impossible.\n\nIn fact, from my experience, most folks in the world of FIRE have kids. It’s the norm rather than the exception. (This 2019 article from Marketwatch profiles several families pursuing financial independence, including Angela from Tread Lightly, Retire Early.)\n\nKids are only a barrier to your financial goals if you allow them to be. And the reality is that many people in the FIRE community take great pleasure in their children, especially in educating them about how money works. (Doug Nordman recently published a book called Raising Your Money-Savvy Family for Next Generation Financial Independence. That’s a mouthful, but the gist is FIRE can be a family pursuit.)\n\nFinancial Independence Requires Extreme Frugality\n\nProbably the second-most common misconception is that financial independence requires extreme frugality. “I don’t want to live like a miser,” people tell me, and they dismiss the FIRE movement without fully understanding it.\n\nWhile thrift is certainly a virtue, it is not a requirement for achieving financial independence. If you have a high income, it’s perfectly possible to retire early even while enjoying a luxurious lifestyle during your working years. (But a good salary is required for this to work.)\n\nIf your income is average — or less — then some degree of frugality is needed, no doubt. Again, financial independence is all about math. There are only two variables here: what you earn and what you spend. If you can’t adjust one variable to boost your saving rate, then you have to adjust the other. (Ideally, you’d adjust both.)\n\nFor the sake of completeness, I should point out that there’s actually a third variable involved. What you do with your savings is also important, so your return on investments is another factor. But these are the three fundamental variables of financial independence: what you earn, what you spend, and the rate of return you earn on the difference.\n\nBelieve it or not, the afore-mentioned FIRE survey found just one key difference between those are and those who aren’t on the path to financial independence: F.I. folks spend about 7% less of their income on housing — and put about 7% more of their income into saving and investments. (These numbers are more striking if you frame them differently. FIRE folks allocate 30% less of their budget to housing but set aside 78% more of their budget for investing.)\n\nSo, what’s the source of the misconception that financial independence requires hard-core thrift? I think it probably stems from the fact that two of the earliest proponents of the modern FIRE movement were Jacob from Early Retirement Extreme and Pete from Mr. Money Mustache, both of whom advocate extreme frugality as a path to wealth. They’re not wrong. But they’re not the only ones who are right.\n\nFinancial Independence Requires a High Income\n\nThe flip side of the “extreme frugality” myth is the belief that financial independence requires a six-figure salary.\n\nNow, this myth is grounded in reality. Most folks in the FIRE movement do have high incomes. They’re doctors or software engineers or entrepreneurs. Or they work multiple jobs so that they can earn more. The TD Ameritrade survey makes this clear. While it is possible to pursue F.I. with a low income, it’s much easier to do so with more money.\n\nThere’s a reason for this. You reach FIRE by increasing the gap between your earning and spending. Thus, a high income absolutely accelerates the process.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of people who reach financial independence without making millions of dollars. This is only possible, though, if you keep your expenses low. Remember, this is all about math. You want to increase the difference between your income and expenses. If your income is low and you can’t (or won’t) increase it, then your only option is to cut expenses.\n\nAlso, I hope it’s obvious to you that if both of these beliefs exist — FIRE is only possible through extreme frugality and FIRE is only possible with a high income — then neither is likely accurate. Because that’s the truth.\n\nIn reality, financial independence is best achieved by finding balance, by doing whatever possible to both increase earnings while decreasing expenses. Ultimately, your aim is to increase the gap between the two, to increase your saving rate. How you choose to do this depends on your own strengths, goals, and circumstances\n\nLet’s look at some actual data! According to the TD Ameritrade survey about financial independence, FIRE folks take both approaches: increasing income and reducing expenses. But one is a clear favorite.\n\nOf those surveyed, nearly twice as many people prefer to increase their saving rate by cutting expenses rather than increasing income. From my experience, this is largely due to the fact that it’s easier to cut costs than to boost earning power. If you were motivated, you could slash your non-housing expenses drastically in only a couple of weeks. But it takes time and planning to increase your income.\n\nFinancial Independence Is a Get-Rich-Quick Cult\n\nMy brain has grown numb from the people who call the FIRE movement a cult. It’s not a cult. There’s no leader. There’s no rulebook. There isn’t even collective agreement on many of the core concepts. (Seriously, you should see the arguments in the financial independence subreddit.)\n\nThe FIRE movement is a loose collection of like-minded folks who are all pursuing similar aims: They want to save enough that they can quit their day jobs and pursue more meaningful lives.\n\nNow, it’s true that FIRE folks can exhibit cult-like qualities.\n\nThey’re enthusiastic about the subject, so they can be evangelical and want to share with the people they meet.\n\nThey use a lot of jargon, which is unfortunate.\n\nThey tend to lead unconventional lives, eschewing a lot of what most people consider “normal”. (I downsized from a fancy 1800-square-foot penthouse condo, for instance, to a quirky 1100-square foot “country cottage”.)\n\nThey tend to hang out with each other, both online and in the Real World.\n\nIt’s also true that the FIRE movement is indeed about getting rich quickly. (Or quick-ish, anyhow.) But this isn’t a bad thing.\n\nTypically when we talk about get-rich-quick schemes, we mean shady enterprises that are somehow meant to trick people and/or build wealth by cutting corners. These schemes are scams. They offer promises that cannot possibly be fulfilled.\n\nFinancial independence isn’t a scam. It’s math. There’s nothing shady about it. It’s simply the process of putting existing tools to use in a highly-efficient manner so that you can make the numbers work in your favor.\n\nMost folks save 5% to 10% of their income. Aggressive financial advisors urge their clients to save 20%. People in the FIRE movement have saving rates of 50% — or higher. There’s nothing scammy about saving more of your own money.\n\nFinancial Independence Is Only Possible Through Privilege and Luck\n\nDuring the past year, a new myth has reared its ugly head. And it’s a myth that gets me riled up.\n\nSome have begun to argue that financial independence and early retirement are only options for folks blessed by privilege or luck. (Better yet, both.) The point of these pieces — whether explicit or implied — is that preaching the power of personal responsibility is misguided, that we should instead focus on the Big Picture in order to improve economic opportunity for people.\n\nI agree that privilege and luck do make it easier for some folks to achieve their financial goals than others. I, as a white man, have enjoyed benefits that other demographics have not. And systemic poverty is a real problem. Fundamentally, there are barriers that make it extremely difficult for certain people to succeed. I think it’s great that there are people out there who want to prioritize a fight for public policy that leads to increased wealth for more people.\n\nHaving said that, I also value personal responsibility. I’m not going to mince words here: Those who deny the power of self-determination are full of bullshit. No, agency isn’t going to be equally effective for every person. Some who take action will enjoy better results. Some people are starting from much better positions than others. And bad things will happen. They happen to everyone.\n\nBut I believe — strongly — that individual action is always the most effective way for any given individual to better her circumstances. In fact, “action beats inaction” is one of the fundamental tenets of my financial philosophy.\n\nIt’s so frustrating to to hear people argue that personal action doesn’t work. They’re wrong. And what they’re doing (without realizing it, I think) is giving people permission to do nothing about their circumstances instead of resolving to take responsibility.\n\nHere’s the thing that really bugs me though. This is a false dichotomy. It’s not either-or. These aims aren’t mutually exclusive. You can pursue both systemic change and personal responsibility at the same time. That’s how I’ve tried to live my life, and that’s how many others in the FIRE movement live theirs. I believe that those who argue solely for policy change are just as misguided as those who argue solely for personal responsibility.\n\nPrivilege and luck play a hand in the FIRE movement, yes. But from my experience chatting with hundreds of early retirees over the past decade, more folks find financial independence through deliberate efforts to save more and spend less than through the whims of fate.\n\nSome will dismiss my response here simply because I’m a white guy. Fortunately, the message of self-determination is prominent in all demographic groups. Because it’s important. For instance, check out The Wealth Choice: Success Secrets of Black Millionaires from Dennis Kimbro or A Latina’s Guide to Money by Eva Macias. Same message, different delivery vehicles.\n\nFinancial Independence Means Never Working Again\n\nIt’s a persistent myth that when somebody retires early, she’ll never work again. People think that once you achieve financial independence, you transition to an indolent life of luxury: beaches, martinis, pedicures, personal assistants. This simply isn’t so.\n\nIn nearly every case I know, folks who achieve FIRE maintain their existing lifestyle. In fact, that’s usually the goal. People on the path to financial independence generally make a deliberate decision to save enough to fund their current way of life. That’s the explicit aim. Only a handful of people want to live large after early retirement.\n\nPlus, many of people do choose to work in early retirement, just as many choose to work after traditional retirement. The so-called Internet Retirement Police want to argue that “if you work, you aren’t retired”, but this is bullshit. This has never been the definition of retirement.\n\nWork gives people purpose. It offers meaning. It lets them do good work that improves their community — and the world. And sure, work provides additional income. There’s nothing wrong with that. If anything, earning more in retirement is a smart risk-mitigation measure. But mostly, the jobs we take after reaching financial independence help us to fend off ennui.\n\nI always use myself as an example when tackling this subject. I have enough saved that I don’t have to work again if I don’t want to. And, in fact, I took some time off for a couple of years to do nothing. But you know what? A life of leisure isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. It turns out that writing about money makes me happy. It brings me fulfillment and gives me a reason to get up every morning!\n\nI’m reminded of the end of one of my favorite TV shows, The Good Place. (Spoiler alert!) Our main characters reach the quasi-heaven of the afterlife, where every wish is fulfilled and life is perfect. But they’re surprised to find that the existing population of The Good Place is anything but happy. The residents are numb. They’re bored. Why? Because having it all doesn’t mean anything without context.\n\nFinancial Independence Is All About Greed\n\nAnother myth that bugs me is the belief that the FIRE movement is all about greed, that we’re a bunch of Scrooge McDucks looking to hoard our wealth for selfish purposes.\n\nSure, there are people who are in this only for themselves. They’re like Han Solo in Star Wars, who has no interest in defeating the Galactic Empire. “Look, I ain’t in this for your revolution,” he says. “I’m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I’m in it for the money.”\n\nIf that’s your aim, fine. I’m okay with that. Who am I to judge other people’s motivations? But I think it’s a mistake to ascribe this motive to everyone in the FIRE movement. (Or even to most people in the FIRE movement!) Those who learn about financial independence and stick with it often have higher aims.\n\nFamously, Mr. Money Mustache, one of FIRE’s most prominent voices, makes no secret that his website is only secondarily about money. His goal is to get people to live lighter on the world. He wants to help the environment by reducing consumption. He wants people to be rich, happy, and to save the world.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BDWih309wc\n\nOr there’s Vicki Robin, one of the modern FIRE movement’s earliest voices. When I wrote to ask about her initial inspiration, Vicki responded:\n\n“I wanted the world to be a better place. More beautiful. More aligned with my highest sense of interrelatedness of life. I was also influenced by Thoreau and Emerson. I studied utopian communities as early as high school…Money itself was never of interest.”\n\nVicki’s vision is clearly evident in Your Money or Your Life, her 1992 book that inspired many folks in the FIRE movement to pursue this path.\n\nAnd what about about Tanja Hester from Our Next Life? Tanja is all about using her position in early retirement as a force for good.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I’ve thought a lot about this, and I’ve had many discussions about the topic. In fact, I’ve begun developing a talk on this subject, which I presented for the first time in October 2019. And it’s a big reason that I recently ordered a copy of What We Owe to Each Other by T.M. Scanlon. (The other reason? “ELEANOR — FIND CHIDI”.)\n\nFor more on this subject, check out my article on what happens after you achieve financial independence.\n\nFinancial Independence is a Fad\n\nFinally, there are a lot of people who believe the FIRE movement is a fad, and that its popularity will fade with time.\n\nSome would put me in this camp. I’ve been very vocal that I do believe FIRE’s current popularity is a product of the past decade’s roaring economy. Times are good, so personal wealth has grown. People feel rich. They’re interested in topics like early retirement. But when I started Get Rich Slowly, things were bleaker. Frugality and thrift and getting out of debt were the popular topics.\n\nThe past 11-12 years have produced an extraordinary set of circumstances that have allowed many people to build wealth quickly — if they had the ability (and knowledge) to invest in either real estate or the stock market. As a result, there’s a bunch of people who find they’re able to retire early if they want, and that’s led to greater interest in the FIRE ideals.\n\nIn one talk recently, I claimed that we’ve reached “peak FIRE”. And I stand by that. But while I think we’re at (or near) peak popularity for this subject, I do not think financial independence is a fad. In fact, I know it’s not.\n\nIf you research the history of financial independence, you can see that this idea has been around for a long, long time. In 1758, Benjamin Franklin was espousing many of the core concepts we know and love today. But it wasn’t just Franklin. Throughout the 19th century (and into the 20th), many books promoted “pecuniary independence” as a path to financial fulfillment.\n\nWhat we’ve seen lately — over the past eight years or so — is a rapid refinement of these concepts, a codification of the steps required to build wealth rapidly. It’s sort of how the the various elements that make up the theory of evolution had been around for centuries, but it wasn’t until Darwin published On the Origin of Species that the entire process was neatly packaged in one place.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMost of these myths about financial independence and early retirement stem from the same problem: assuming that the FIRE movement is homogenous, that there’s some unifying motive or method. There’s not. Financial independence isn’t simply one thing. Early retirement is different for everyone.\n\nFrom my experience, the only thing that unites FIRE folks is math. This pursuit is only possible by creating a personal profit, a gap between what you earn and spend. That’s it. That’s the only commonality.\n\nBefore I close, I’d like to address one final myth. There are those who discover the idea of financial independence later in life. They don’t decide they want to retire early until their forties — or fifties. Too many times, people abandon the idea because they think they just can’t make it happen.\n\nBut according to the survey I’ve been citing this entire article, the average FIRE adherent starts his journey to financial independence at age 37 and plans to retire in twenty years. Only one-third of FIRE folks start before age 30. (In July, I met Becky Heptig who writes the blog Started at 50, which is all about this subject.)\n\nThere’s no question that starting early helps. It makes a huge difference. But you know what’s better than starting yesterday? Starting today. Don’t fret having waited so long. Start where you are.\n\nIf you’re intrigued by financial independence and early retirement but don’t know where to start, check out The Money Boss Manifesto, my free guide to achieving financial freedom. There are no sales pitches in this thing. It’s not an attempt to upsell you. (I don’t think I even ask you to sign up for my mailing list!) The Money Boss Manifesto is a legit free introduction to the framework of financial independence and early retirement.\n\nIf this subject interests you and you want to learn more, you should read it.\n\nTo wrap things up, I’d like to point out that my buddy Diania Merriam recently hosted a webinar about FIRE misconceptions, assumptions, and criticisms. Diania is the founder of the EconoMe conference, and I’ve been helping her in a volunteer capacity lately. She’s awesome. I haven’t watched the video from the webinar, but I suspect it’s solid.

Or was it subconscious?\n\nThe reason why diversity is needed bc people just tend to hang out with and take care of people who look like themselves.\n\nPlease recognize your bias JD. Plenty of amazing other people in the FIRE community who don’t all look like you.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.D. says\n\t\t\t\t11 December 2020 at 16:21\n\nSorry, Febe. This was flagged by our spam filter. I only now just caught it.\n\nWarning: This response is long. And I’m riled up by your comment because, honestly, you’re a part of the very issue I’m describing.\n\nI think you’re right that there’s a problem with the same people being highlighted over and over again in the world of FIRE. When articles are written about financial independence and early retirement, reporters always interview the same folks. It’s the same cast of characters telling the same stories. They’re good characters and good stories, but it’s repetitive and serves to create a narrow view of what FIRE is (and can be).\n\nSo, I try to be diligent about finding new creators and, when possible, featuring them (both here and Apex Money). For instance, I pointed to Becky from Started at 50 in this article.\n\nThat said, one reason certain people get mentioned over and over is that they’ve played a foundational role. I talk about Vicki Robin, Doug Nordman, Jacob Lund Fisker, and Pete Adeney all of the time (and so do many others) because they played pivotal roles in stoking the modern FIRE movement. If other folks had sparked the fire, I’d highlight them instead.\n\nI certainly try not to propagate this problem. As I say, I’m constantly searching for new material from new writers. I do my best to feature men and women equally. (I even alternate male and female pronouns when giving hypothetical examples.) And, when possible, I try to point to non-white contributions to personal finance (and to FIRE, in particular).\n\nBut sometimes perception doesn’t match reality. For instance, you claim that I only highlighted white men in this post when I explicitly did not do that. \n\nHere, in order, are the people I talk about or link to in this piece. In each case, this was a deliberate, conscious choice. There wasn’t anything subconscious about it.\n\nSuze Orman (via Paula Pant*)\n\nAngela Rozmyn (via Tanja Hester)\n\nDoug Nordman\n\nJacob Lund Fisker\n\nPeter Adeney\n\nEmma Pattee (via Chelsea Fagan)\n\nDennis Kimbro*\n\nEva Macias*\n\nPeter Adeney, again\n\nVicki Robin\n\nTanja Hester\n\nBecky Heptig\n\nDiania Merriam\n\nThose folks marked with as asterisk* are people of color. Now, let’s look at the demographics here.\n\nWomen (10): Suze Orman, Paula Pant* , Angela Rozmyn, Tanja Hester (x2), Emma Pattee, Chelsea Fagan, Eva Macias*, Vicki Robin, Becky Heptig, Diania Merriam\n\nMen (4): Doug Nordman, Jacob Lund Fisker, Peter Adeney (x2), Dennis Kimbro*\n\nSo, four of the fourteen people whose work I featured here — or about 29% — are men. That’s six out of sixteen (38%) if you count when I name-drop Franklin and Darwin. (Let’s count them because it makes some numbers prettier in a moment.) Yet you read this as me highlighting only men. Why is that?\n\nNow, let’s compare U.S. demographics to the demographics of the folks featured here. (I got my numbers from the U.S. Census website.)\n\n* U.S. Population: women (50.8%), men (49.2%), white (76.3%) — so, we can extrapolate white women (38.8%), white men (37.5%), people of color (23.7%)\n\n* This article: women (62.5%), men (37.5%), white (81.3%), white women (50%), white men (31.3%), people of color (18.8%)\n\nObviously, I never write articles looking to get that close to statistical averages, but come on. That’s pretty fucking good! Amazing, really. Is it possible to do much better using a sample size of sixteen? Yes, by featuring fewer white women and more white men.\n\nSo, let’s revisit what you wrote: “You basically help propagate this reality by only highlight white men and then some white women in this post.”\n\nLet me ask you: Who is the one exhibiting bias here, me or you? It’s you. And let me ask you what you asked me. Were you aware of what you did? Or was it subconscious?\n\nLook, there’s no question I have bias. We all do. We can’t avoid it. But I work hard to be aware of my bias and to make GRS an inclusive place. It’s frustrating to do all of this work and have readers not only not notice it, but then claim I’ve done the opposite of what I’ve actually done.\n\nPlease recognize your bias, Febe. Because what you just did isn’t helpful.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tyogi says\n\t\t\t\t13 December 2020 at 23:18\n\nJust saw this comment.\n\nWanted to endorse JD’s point about divesity and how FI principles are universally applicable to all demographics.\n\nWith my personal example.\n\nI am a 50-year old middle-income male from India, a low income country. Following these solid FI principles for more than a decade, am at the cusp of FI.\n\nThe principles are the same- living below one’s means, prudent investment with a defined asset allocation in low-cost (index) funds  aiming to reach 25X ( X=annual expenses) with discipline over years.\n\nHave been a GRS reader for 14 years now and this site has helped me stick to the path of FI.\n\nSo JD, a warm hug to you.

I’ve been known to voice my frustrations regarding the FIRE movement in the past. I continued to look at it from an outsider’s POV and thought it was a bit misleading in many aspects. I agree with your points though and have since calmed down a bit and have accepted what FIRE actually is and what it is not. \n\nI found your point regarding housing of particular interest. My husband and I bought another primary home about a year ago and we really struggled with making the right purchase. We struggled against our lifelong desires of a big suburban home and the practical needs of our 3-member family. Ultimately, the FIRE burned. We decided on a modestly sized home in order to keep our high savings rate and goal of financial independence. \n\nAgain, thanks for this. I enjoyed it as my first article of the morning. ??\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJoe says\n\t\t\t\t11 December 2020 at 06:42\n\nThis is a pretty thorough rundown of the FIRE myths.  I think it’s really an excuse to avoid making a big change. Most people believe it’s easier to keep on doing what they’re doing. It’s hard to change your lifestyle.\n\nThat’s probably best, really. Consumer spending is 70% of the US economy. If everyone changes their spending habit, the economy would be even worse.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tRyan says\n\t\t\t\t11 December 2020 at 12:30\n\nIt could be the same amount of spending, just delayed. Sure there may be some contraction at first, but as people retired, they would spend more in retirement than current retirees do.\n\nI know that’s the way it’s going to be for my wife and me. We’re saving now to spend later.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJoel says\n\t\t\t\t11 December 2020 at 07:41\n\nLove it JD. I hear the “no kids” misconception a lot. Some people think because I don’t have kids that’s the sole differentiator between me and them achieving FIRE.   Sure, having no kids might put me a little ahead financially, but it’s not the only difference.  You said it well, “Kids are only a barrier if you allow them to be”.\n\ncheers and happy Friday!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFred says\n\t\t\t\t11 December 2020 at 07:44\n\nGreat article. FIRE is no fad. My grandfather was born poor. He worked hard and retied at age 49 in 1961. He raised a family along the way. He started a small business as a hobby. It was very successful, he hired several people. He hired more people than he strictly needed so he could work less himself. He was FI so he didn’t need to work all day.\n\nMy 1st boss retired in his early 50’s in 1993. Sold the family home and traveled with his wife for the rest of his life.\n\nBoth men were smart and industrious. They didn’t waste money but they also had their toys and fun activities. Wise and balanced lives.

The concept I like to think of “f-you money”, where one gets to the point where they only work because they enjoy what they do, they make an impact, they get fulfillment from the work, but they don’t need to for the paycheck alone; finally, and most importantly, they can walk away if the work isn’t satisfying anymore. Interestingly enough, at least for my experience, the closer I’ve come to that point (probably another 3-5 years out for me and my family), the more I’ve been earning and the easier money has become. This seems strange to me in some ways, but I certainly am not complaining.\n\nThere is one area of the FIRE movement where I am skeptical, however, since in the US health insurance (good health insurance anyways) is still largely tied to employment, how do people handle that?\n\nI have a need for high quality health insurance coverage, and the premiums for what my family needs (based on employer provided plans) end up usually between $20k – $25k/year (total cost of the plan). I’ve always viewed health insurance more as a “health care” plan rather than “insurance” (which implies that it should only be used for “emergencies / unforeseen events”). I would be fine  to go without regular “health care” insurance and only have emergency / catastrophic coverage if I could walk into a doctors office and pay what insurance companies pays them (i.e. the pre-negotiated rate), which is usually about 10-20% of the amount that gets billed. I’ve actually successfully done that in Europe when my wife was pregnant and we were traveling and she needed to continue her ultra sounds… cost ~$100 at the time for a full consultation, ultrasound and some medication that the local doctor recommended as a precaution. That’s totally manageable, but I can’t imagine the same thing costing less than $1000 in the US without insurance.\n\nHow do people in FIRE handle health care when they actually need it for maintenance conditions / expensive periodic tests / medications?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tSelena says\n\t\t\t\t12 December 2020 at 06:04\n\nThe biggest myth about FIRE is that it’s somehow a new concept/movement. It’s not new. It’s only new to a certain subset of the population.\n\nBeing smart with money, mostly through frugality, is common in my family and a certain subset of my friends and co-workers. And we didn’t need a guide. This mindset is common sense to us.\n\nWho are we? Immigrants and people of color.\n\nMy department is dissolving and I’ll be laid off in February. Some of my coworkers are completely baffled because I’m neither panicking nor even upset. Why? Because I’m going to take my severance and retire at 40.

Thank you for sharing the PDF of that TD Ameritrade study; I can’t believe I hadn’t seen it prior to today. I think what steered me most toward this lifestyle was growing up in an anti-FIRE home. Mom and dad cut expenses to the bone in favor of wanton spending on crap (due to mom’s perceived deprivation by Depression-inspired parents); she threw obscene resources at whatever hobby-of-the-month caught her eye but we didn’t own a car with air conditioning until the mid-90s. “Cheaper than therapy,” she always laughed.\n\nAfter decades with an example like that, I grasped FIRE like a lifeline to trade frivolity for security.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMelody says\n\t\t\t\t15 December 2020 at 09:08\n\nOne issue I’ve had with FIRE is how these people are planning for health insurance. My husband has a lot of issues, and there’s no way we could afford his medicines without insurance. My federal job provides excellent insurance, but I can’t retire early and keep the insurance. Buying decent insurance on the open market doesn’t seem possible, without making a LOT of money (but perhaps I’m wrong there?). I feel like I HAVE to keep my job, just for the insurance! Which is really not a fun feeling…some parts of my job are nice, but there’s a lot of red tape that drives me crazy and it only seems to get to be more over time. Is there any ideas or writings out there that addresses the health insurance problem?\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.D. says\n\t\t\t\t15 December 2020 at 10:29\n\nAs an aging member of the FIRE movement, I agree.

Last year I finally went to a financial advisor  and when I brought up that I would like to retire earlier than 67 he nodded and then pointed out that I am going to need a lot more money to account for the cost of health insurance and suggested I keep working for as long as I can. I kind of bristled at that and felt like he wasn’t really taking me seriously. But since then I have been doing some research and indeed, health insurance is one of my biggest worries about retiring early. I’m lucky that I am young and healthy now but that could change in a heartbeat. So for now I am socking away as much money as I can but it sort of feels like he’s right – my current health insurance with my company is pretty cheap so it makes sense to stick it out as long as I can.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tMelody says\n\t\t\t\t11 January 2021 at 11:24\n\nI didn’t get any notification about a reply on here, so I’m just seeing this now!

Do they need the extra income or do they not know what to do with their extra free time?  I quit working 28 years ago at 45.  I don’t think FIRE existed then.  I didn’t intend to retire but I had just made a big mistake and took a new job.  The company lied to me so I quit after 3 months and finished the house I was building.  When I was done, I decided I did not want to work again.  My biggest regret is that I was too frugal.

This is another myth I should address when I revise this article: “Seems like everyone in the FIRE movement writes a blog or has a hobby career to supplement their income.”\n\nVery few FIRE folks write blogs. And some of us who do write blogs have been doing so for years. In my case, I’ve been blogging for DECADES — before blog was even a word. And I’ve been writing about money for almost fifteen years. When I started, I was writing about debt reduction, but I’ve turned to more advanced topics (like FIRE) over the years. I think there are plenty of FIRE blogs because it’s a subject that people naturally want to evangelize. The concept changed their lives, so they want to share it with others.\n\nAnother important point is that most folks writing FIRE blogs aren’t doing it for the money. Very few blogs make any real money. (Hell, GRS only earns about $1500 – $2000 per month right now, and it’s a pretty big site!) From talking with folks who do have FIRE blogs, they’re not doing it to supplement their income. This is a motivation that’s been ascribed to them by other people. It’s a myth. A misconception.\n\nThis is worth fleshing out when I re-visit this article in a couple of years…\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tmary w says\n\t\t\t\t18 December 2020 at 13:35\n\nI’m not a huge reader of FIRE blogs, but I’ve always noticed how many are ethnically Asian (or have Asian spouses) and frequently immigrants.  Justin at Root of Good has a Cambodian immigrant wife (by way of a Thai refugee camp); Joe at Retire by 40 is a Thai immigrant; even MMM’s wife (now ex-wife) is ethnically Indian; Financial Samurai is, I assume, ethnically Asian.\n\nThe only other FIRE (or FIRE adjacent) blogs I read are GRS and the Frugalwoods which don’t have an Asian component.\n\nNot sure what this means.

Slow and steady wins the race.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tPS says\n\t\t\t\t28 December 2020 at 06:16\n\nI agree, one can push for systemic change and financial independence; it’s how I roll as well.  But, many of the policies that help lift people out of poverty may mean less savings for you in the form of higher taxes, occasional slower market growth, etc.  I’m ok with that, but I don’t see FIRE advocates talking about it [in a positive light].  It’s totally fair that they may not feel it’s their business to talk about it, but it’s partly why the myth exists.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDividend Quest says\n\t\t\t\t01 January 2021 at 20:58\n\nI liked your Han Solo reference and quote, as it pretty much reflects my own view. At 53, I’m at the point where my concerns are limited to me, my kin, and friends. I’m not into any causes except those that directly affect me. Am I being greedy? Maybe. I’m not as mercenary as Han, but then I don’t have the overhead expenses that come with owning a high speed starship.\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tNick G says\n\t\t\t\t08 March 2021 at 11:20\n\nFIRE is only possible through luck and privilege??? Man, my journey completely blows that myth out of the ocean. I’m an African-American man who grew up poor, joined the Air Force at 18 (enlisted) and only made $8K (gross) my first year in. Five years after joining, an AF buddy referred me to a personal finance book. I read the book but only took action on a couple of simple things. I didn’t start investing in the stock market until four years after reading the book (1993). $50/month in the Janus Fund is what I chose to invest because I was a little nervous about the market. Why? NO ONE in my family invested in the stock market. They thought it was for rich people and didn’t trust it. Well, I continued to educate myself on personal finance and my anxiety about the market slowly disappeared. As I got promoted, I upped my monthly contribution in the mutual fund. I also opened an IRA and contributed $50/month to it. Over the years, I increased my monthly contributions to my taxable mutual fund, converted to a Roth IRA and started maxing it out. When I retired from the AF, I became a contractor and contributed to my company’s 401K. Long story short, 22 years after my first $50 investment in the Janus Fund, I reached FI. And this was accomplished in spite of the many, MANY financial mistakes I made along the way. I know for a fact that the primary reason I hit FI is I never stopped investing in mutual funds. Hell or high water, my auto-contributions never stopped. Compound interest did the heavy lifting. It truly is the 8th wonder of the world. FI was that easy. Reaching FI is the greatest accomplishment of my professional career. Not stressing about money like so many in my family was my #1 financial goal. I’m talking generations of hard-working, honest, wonderful, beautiful people who always struggled to make ends meet. Financial stress affects every facet of life. I’ve seen it up close. I never wanted that. I decided to break the chains of financial slavery. I will raise my daughter to be financially responsible/savvy to ensure she will never be a financial slave like so many Americans. I will teach her that wealth is invisible. Forget buying the latest I-Pad. Buy Apple stock instead because it’s better to be rich than look rich imo. I know a lot of broke people with pretty, shiny stuff.\n\nSo, those who think FI and FIRE are only for the lucky and privileged, you’re wrong. I know several guys with similar backgrounds and circumstances as mine who hit FI. Some of us work, some don’t but none of us have to. No better feeling!\n\n\t\t\tReply\t\t\n\nLeave a reply\n\n\t\t\t\tClick here to cancel reply.\t\t\t\n\nYour email address will not be published.

(Or Someone Who’s in Denial?)\n\nI Spend Too Much Money…What Should I Do?\n\nShould People Walk Out on Their Debt?\n\nHow Do You Afford Your Lifestyle?\n\nTravel Questions\n\nIs it Safe to Carry Cash When Traveling?\n\nHow Can You Afford to Travel the World?\n\nHow Do You Afford Health Care While Traveling?\n\nWhat Did You Do With Your Stuff When You Traveled?\n\nReal Estate Questions\n\nHow Much Does Maintaining a Rental Property Cost?\n\nWhat if I Can’t Hit the One Percent Rule with a Rental?\n\nHow Do You Lead Tenants from “Showing” to “Move-In”?\n\nHow Do You Estimate Repairs on a Property?\n\nShould You Buy Properties from a Wholesaler?\n\nI’m Upside-Down on My Home. Should I Rent it or Sell it?\n\nShould I Buy a House with Cash?\n\nShould You Buy a Vacation Rental?\n\nLife and Work Questions\n\nShould I Go to Grad School?\n\nCan You Escape the Ordinary? How?\n\nIs There a Secret to Success?\n\nHow to Deal with Financial Denial?\n\n \n\n“I was wondering if you have ever written an article on converting the (financial) ‘non-believers’?\n\n“I’ve been trying to get my girlfriend to … help us be financially free, but I am having trouble getting her to participate. I know she’s scared to read personal finance blogs and make a budget because she doesn’t want to know how much she wastes every month. She’s in denial.\n\n“I’ve encountered this apprehension with many people in my life. I’m sure it’s a psychological defense mechanism, the ignorance is bliss syndrome. Do you have any tips on inspiring these kind of people?”\n\nSuccess unfolds when we face the brutal facts about our situation, no matter how dire, while simultaneously having faith that we’ll achieve our goals in the end.\n\nI didn’t make that up. That idea is called the Stockdale Paradox, and it’s named after Admiral Jim Stockdale, a Vietnam prisoner-of-war who helped his soldiers face the brutal reality that they wouldn’t escape their imprisonment for a long time … while simultaneously trusting in their eventual freedom.\n\nSo how do you encourage someone in denial to “face the brutal facts?”\n\nA lot of people are turned off by the notion of skimping and saving, but they LOVE the idea of quitting their lousy job.\n\nI’d probably approach the topic with your girlfriend by showing her how passive income can allow her to buy the things she loves. She gets to continue living her lifestyle — AND doesn’t need to work in order to support it!\n\nThat should get her attention. Once you’ve piqued her interest, show her how setting aside some money now will create passive income streams for the rest of her life.\n\nThis post shows how I created $4,400 per year in passive income from just one of my several rental units. Meanwhile, the guy who lives in that unit, the guy who works hard to earn that rent money, drives a brand-new Mercedes-Benz. If I wanted a Benz, I could buy it purely from passive income in 8 years. (Of course, I could also re-invest that passive income and be one step closer to freedom …)\n\nPeople are motivated by different factors. I’m motivated by freedom. So are plenty of the Afford Anything readers. Most of us want the autonomy to decide how to live our lives, without being pushed around by economic pressures.\n\nBut some people are motivated by material objects — houses, cars, clothes. That’s fine. Tap that motivation, and use it as the source that inspires you to waste less, invest more.\n\nYou can fritter money away mindlessly and then stress about the bills (ignorance), or you can retire at 40, travel to Bali and live in a mansion (bliss!). Sometimes it helps to start with the end in mind.\n\nShould I Go to Grad School?\n\n \n\nI’m 24 years old. I have a marketing job making about $40k per year (before taxes), half of which I live on, the other half goes into a savings account, which I use for my student loan payment and my Roth IRA contribution. I have about $18k in student loan debt. I have about $15k saved in a Roth IRA, and a few thousand in a 401k plan. I’m happy with what I’ve been able to accomplish so far, but I want to do more.\n\nI’ve been accepted into the MBA program. Total tuition and fees will run me about $15,000. The motivating factor for me wanting to get my MBA is to be able to teach business and marketing classes at a University. In my area, these positions are typically paid around $50,000 per year. Not a bad rate of return, invest $15k and earn $10k more in just one year….. BUT is it worth taking out the extra student loan debt? (This would take my total debt up to around $35k — yuck!)\n\nYou’ve stated that your motivation is to teach business/marketing classes at the college/university level. That’s key information, and its good to hear. Getting a masters degree is a mandatory prerequisite to getting that job.\n\nIf you had written to me and said, “I want a marketing position at a company,” I’d be a bit more hesitant about recommending that you go to grad school. After all, you can get a marketing job with your bachelor’s degree, and then climb your way up by being an awesome performer. Once you’re on-board with the company, most people won’t know what your highest level of education is. And your rockstar performance at the company will matter more than your education.\n\nBut teaching at the college level is different — the degree is literally a requirement; it’s an unavoidable price of entry. So if that’s what you really want to do, then I think that you should go for it.\n\nBUT — and here’s the but —\n\nFirst I want you to ask yourself one question: Is this your dream?\n\nDon’t take that question lightly. Are you going to want this same dream (teaching at the college level) within two years, when you graduate? Do you want it badly enough that you’re willing to sacrifice traveling, delay investing, delay buying a home and throwing a wedding and having kids, for the sake of pursing this dream?\n\nIf your answer is yes, then absolutely go for it. I have no objection to people consciously making sacrifices in other areas of their life for the sake of pursuing a dream. In fact, I think that’s admirable. Everyone who has done anything noteworthy has made plenty of sacrifices along the way.\n\nMy only “beef” is with people who assume they should go to grad school because they’re “expected” to, or because they’re dissatisfied with their current job, or because their friends did it. That’s not sacrifice on behalf of a dream … that’s sacrifice for no real good reason, other than succumbing to social pressure.\n\nIs it Safe to Carry Cash When Traveling?\n\n \n\nHow do you pay for things when you’re traveling? Is it safe to carry that much cash around?\n\nThe more you’re off-the-beaten-path, the more likely cash is your only choice.\n\nIf you’re in Burma, buying a cup of tea from a market stall, you’ll need cash. But in more developed countries, you’ll be able to swipe plastic.\n\nDon’t assume that “developed countries” is synonymous with the Western world. There are plenty of highly developed countries across the Middle East and Asia. The United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Malaysia – these nations, especially their major cities, are far more advanced than you might imagine. (The flashy wealth in Kuala Lumpur is unbelievable. It’s what I imagine Beverly Hills to look like.)\n\nSo, onto the second part of your question – how do you keep your money safe? Credit cards give you the highest levels of fraud protection, so use it when you can. When you use cash, withdraw money from an ATM rather than going to a money-changer. You’ll get the best exchange rate.\n\nWithdraw ONLY as much cash as you need for about a week. Put the majority of that into a “money belt” that you wear under your pants. Stash only one day’s worth of cash into your wallet. That way, if you get pick-pocketed, you’ll only lose a day’s bills.\n\nCan You Escape the Ordinary?\n\n \n\n“I am a single woman with children who believes I can live a great life traveling and making life grand, in spite of the statistics out there. Do you think its possible? Can you offer some saving/investing tips?”\n\nI’m so glad you wrote to me. YES, I think it’s possible to live any life that you desire. I absolutely, completely, 100 percent believe that.\n\nIgnore the statistics. You’re not a stat. You’re an outlier. The upper end of the bell curve. You’re unique.\n\nHow do I know that? Because you dared to ask. You wrote to me — a complete stranger — for advice. Most people wouldn’t do that. Most people would sit on the couch watching American Idol reruns.\n\nMost people — regardless of their age, income, family or financial situation — don’t have the courage to dream big. Most people spend the whole day saying self-defeating things like:\n\n“I’ll never be rich.”\n\n“I could never afford that.”\n\n“People like me don’t get to do things like that.”\n\n“Good for her, she gets to galavant and have fun, but I have to (fill-in-the-blank with crummy obligation).”\n\nAnd you know what? Whether you think you can, or think you can’t — either way, you’re right. Life is completely what you make it. Especially if you live in a free, first-world country. Then there’s really nothing stopping you.\n\nRegarding the second half of your question — do I have any saving or investing advice? Of course I do. But I won’t tell you to clip coupons (ugghh) or invest in index funds (though I love ’em!), because those are tactics, and tactical maneuvers are secondary.\n\nThe best advice I can give anyone is to align your spending with your values and priorities.\n\nAlmost every financial stress that I see is the result of people spending in a way that’s misaligned with their priorities. It leads to staggering debt, bankrupt college funds, meager retirements, and — perhaps most terrifying of all — cubicle jobs. Eek!\n\nBut when you can kick back and say, “The most critical thing is food, water, medicine and safety. Let me make sure I can pay for that, not just today but years into the future. And after that, my real dream is …”\n\nThat’s the moment when driving an old car no longer feels like a sacrifice. Would you rather drive an Audi or quit your crummy cubicle job? Would you rather have granite countertops, or the flexibility to take a major career risk?\n\n(By the way, I realize I might sound like I’m anti-luxury items. I’m not. I’m pro-anything that’s a conscious priority. And I’m anti-anything that’s not.)\n\nIn my own experience:\n\nWhen I was 22, I wanted to travel more than anything else in the world. I wanted it so badly I could taste it. I thought about it constantly. And I aligned my spending with this top value.\n\nThat meant that I lived incredibly frugally. I lived in a tiny, tiny studio apartment (I could reach the kitchen sink from the bed — I’m not kidding.) I drove a car that was older than me. I wore thrift-store clothes. And I saved almost $30,000, which allowed me to travel the world nonstop for more than two years.\n\nBut another example:\n\nRight now, my priorities have shifted. I don’t want to do a two-year round-the-world trip anymore. I want to build streams of passive income — so that my money can buy time. I want to live in a comfortable home, work on a MacBook, and enjoy a gym membership — even if it comes at the expense of travel. So my spending has shifted to align with my new priorities.\n\nThat’s what it’s really all about. All the details that financial bloggers talk about — insurance premiums, coupons, the price of gas — those are all just details. That’s minutia.\n\nStep back and take the big-picture view: is your money flowing in the same direction as your values and priorities? If so, you’re in the right place. If not, make a change.\n\nIt’s as simple as that.\n\nPsst – want to learn more about how to escape the 9 to 5 grind? I have a free ebook that details how I did it. Click here for access.\n\nI Spend Too Much Money…What Should I Do?\n\nI often write about figuring out WHY you spend. It’s too simplistic to write a tactical list that says “Don’t Go to Restaurants.” That advice does nothing to address why you’d drop a hard-earned $20 at a restaurant. Are you terrified of cooking? Do you want social interaction? Are you trying to flirt with a particular server?\n\nMoney is about emotions, not laws or logic. So when Kari the musician called into Marketplace Money to say that she spends too much money at bars, the natural question became WHY?\n\nShe rehearses alone all day, so by 5 p.m. she’s starved for human interaction. She goes to bars to socialize.\n\nAwesome. Now we know the root cause.\n\nThat’s when I gave her the weirdest personal finance advice in the world: Keep hitting the bars. (Really, who says that?)\n\nBut while you’re there, remember: you don’t want a $14 martini. You want friendship. Hang out with your friends — while nursing a cheap domestic beer.\n\nDon’t be so Tough on Yourself\n\nAnother caller, Seth, worried he spends too much money watching movies. Of course, he also saves 70 percent of his income.\n\nDear Seth: If you’re saving 70 percent of your income, you rock. So I said something unexpected: maybe you don’t need to save more.\n\nI’m not trying to be contrarian for it’s own sake. But a person with a 70 percent savings rate doesn’t need to be nit-picking at the fringes. I advocate the two-step budget — skim your savings off the top, freely spend the rest. Save a minimum of 20 percent, but ratchet it upward as you see fit. A savings rate of 50-70 percent will bring you unimaginable freedom and options.\n\nThat said, there’s a difference between spending lavishly on something you love vs. frittering cash away on junk. And unless you know your Big Why, any money in your pocket is at risk of getting lost.\n\nPlug the Leaks\n\nMost people are unaware of the leaks in their spending. They think it’s “normal” to buy a luxury car. They think it’s “normal” to spend $100 on a haircut. They think it’s “normal” to throw away clothes that aren’t crisp and new.\n\nWho cares if it’s normal? It’s not good! Normal people are broke. Normal people are drowning in debt. Normal people sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic to get to a job they despise, while daydreaming about the lower-paying but higher-satisfaction career move they’d love to make … if only they could afford it.\n\nWe don’t question spending money on electricity, running water and fresh fruit in the middle of winter, because we value those things. We value them enough to call them “needs,” despite the fact that the majority of mankind hasn’t had those luxuries. When we start questioning an expense, its for one of two reasons: 1) the price is beyond our means, or 2) we don’t love it enough.\n\nIf your gut says you spend too much money something you can easily afford — it’s a leak. That’s not because you can’t afford it. It’s because you don’t love it enough.\n\nIf your gut says you spend too much on something you love, and your budget feels stretched tight — it’s a leak, but for a different reason. You’re not saving enough.\n\nMost leaks in our budget boil down to one of these two issues. Money management is the art of aligning our spending with our values. It sounds simple. But the practice is messy.\n\nThat’s what makes it fun.\n\nIs There a Secret to Success?\n\n \n\n“I turned down two job offers in D.C. because I knew that wasn’t the lifestyle I wanted.There’s nothing that I could want more than to write on my own and become location independent. That’s why I took the easy day job in June to figure out how to make this possible.\n\nSo here’s the question that I’ve hesitated to ask but am dying to know the answer – How do you do it financially? I’m sure people ask you all the time, and I feel like I’m asking some huge secret to success. I’ve seen the few advertising spots on the footer of your pages, and I know you do one-on-one coaching, but certainly there’s more?”\n\nI like that you put the phrase “huge secret to success” in your question. There’s no secret – although you might say there are plenty of secrets, plural.\n\nOur cultural myth says there’s one solution: the Silver Bullet. The Holy Grail. Prince Charming.\n\nThis myth is convenient: Problem, solution. Villain, hero. Life will be great as soon as we find Superman / Sherlock Holmes / the winning lottery ticket.\n\nThanks to this myth, we say things like “I need to invest in the Next Hot Stock,” when in reality we need to invest in 500+ stocks, the majority of which grow profits and shoot out dividends.\n\nWe say “I need an awesome real estate investment,” when in reality we need to create several awesome real estate investments and invest in the market and earn a kick-butt income and not spend too much and legally minimize our taxes.\n\nFunding my location independent life is a bit like finding college scholarships: I enjoy multiple streams of income.\n\n[UPDATE 2015: I now generate enough passive income — via real estate investments — that this money alone can totally support my cost-of-living. The rest of this article, below, was written back when I relied on my freelance/online income to pay the bills. If you’re in that boat, enjoy this article – I hope it helps. 🙂 ]\n\nOne client pays me to edit their weekly newsletter. Another client pays me to write two articles per week. There’s even a print magazine that asks me to write one story per year, during the holiday season when they need all hands on deck. It adds $600 to my pocket each December — enough for a plane ticket to somewhere warm.\n\nOur mind can only track a limited number of tasks. The key this successful juggling act is that I charge what I’m worth. I won’t waste my time on projects that pay a pittance.\n\nRun Your Life Like It’s A Catering Company\n\nImagine that you run a catering company. Each year you cater some massive event like the Wimbledon Championship parties or the SuperBowl box seats.\n\nThis annual event earns your business all the revenue it needs for the year: enough to pay your staff, pay yourself, and cover your overhead.\n\nYou could cruise the easy road and not look for any other jobs. You could bust your butt one month a year and relax the other 11 months.\n\nBut this would be foolish. Your company’s success or failure would depend on a single client. If they drop your contract, you’re screwed.\n\nSo you diversify your income. You start catering weddings, graduations, reunions. They’re less lucrative contracts — more work for less money — but they provide a buffer. If Wimbledon drops you, your company will survive.\n\nAny business owner would do this to protect his company. So why don’t individuals do this to protect themselves?\n\nWhy do we put all our eggs in one basket — relying on one employer for 100% of our income — rather than diversifying into multiple income streams?\n\nHere’s The Huge Secret …\n\nMost of the world sees self-employment – and a location independent life — as unstable. Most of the world is wrong.\n\nPeople who have only one source of income — their full-time job – stand on shaky ground. Every dime hinges on just one “client,” their boss. If they get fired or if their company collapses, they’re screwed.\n\nI have multiple streams of income. I’m diversified. I could lose a client and be fine.\n\nBut there’s a paradox that comes into play. It’s called the Pareto Principle. This principle – also known as the 80/20 rule – states that 80 percent of your results come from 20 percent of your efforts.\n\nIn other words, 80 percent of your income will come from 20 percent of your clients.\n\nThere’s a natural tendency for this to happen. I have a few high-dollar clients – my 20 percent – that pay substantially better than the rest. I put a high priority on making sure these clients are happy. But I also pad my income enough so that I’m not dependent on them.\n\nLosing my best clients would be a bummer. But I’d be fine because I minimized my dependence on these clients – minimized my risk – in advance.\n\nAt heart, this post is about risk management. There’s no Silver Bullet or Superman.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nA single income creates dependence. Multiple streams of income gives you flexibility.\n\nHow Can You Afford to Travel the World?\n\n \n\n“Please could you give more details on how you were able to afford to travel the world.\n\n“What your planned budget was ahead of time, how you earned money ahead of time, how you saved money while you were traveling (e.g couch surfing or hostels), what other ways you cut expenses on food, transportation, and lodging, admission to tourists spots, etc.\n\n“I really would like to know. More specifics would help me evaluate if/how I could implement this in my life.”\n\nIf you want to travel around the world, do it. People regret chances they don’t take more than they regret the opportunities they took.\n\nLet’s tackle your questions one by one.\n\n#1: What Was Your Budget?\n\nI budgeted $1,000 per month, excluding airfare and health insurance. That turned out to be an over-estimate.\n\nIn the Middle East I spent $600 – $700 per month, and that includes the high cost of being “on the go” – such as bus fare. If I had been grounded in just one city, like Cairo, I could have probably gotten by on $500.\n\nSoutheast Asia had the same pricetag. Food and housing cost more, but my travel pace slowed. Those two factors balanced each other out.\n\nAustralia, where I spent 10 months, and Europe, where I spent 3 months, both cost me an average of $22 – $25 per day, which comes to $660 – $750 per month. My “quality of life” (the sacrifices I made in order to live so cheaply) was rougher in Europe and Oz. I lived large in Asia and the Middle East, where $700 a month bought me daily massages and unlimited iced coffees.\n\n#2: How Did You Earn Money Ahead of Time?\n\nBack in the U.S., I worked full-time as a newspaper reporter and editor. My starting salary was $21,000 per year. No one goes into journalism for the money.\n\nBut I hustled. I worked full-time during the day and wrote freelance articles at night. I freelanced for food magazines and for women’s magazines. I reviewed Broadway shows touring through Denver. I wrote for niche publications for the “engraving industry” (how random is that?) and the smoothie-franchise industry (random again!). I wrote until my fingers hurt.\n\nEarning is half the battle; saving is the other half. I lived in a cramped studio apartment. My $400 carwas so rusty that puddles would splash into my lap as I drove. I whittled my living expenses down to $1,000 per month, including rent. I saved the rest.\n\n#3: How Did You Save Money While Traveling?\n\nCouchsurfing.org – a not-for-profit website that lets you sleep on stranger’s couches around the world – is a fantastic tool in some cities and hopeless in others.\n\nIn my experience, Couchsurfing works best in cities with low demand / less competition. I couchsurfed my way around Portugal, but it felt impossible to find a couch in Paris. If you’re considering Couchsurfing.org, start hosting travelers while you’re at home.\n\nAccept Invitations from Strangers\n\nIn the “offline” world (the “real world”), plenty of locals invited me into their home for the night. It’s amazing how many friendships you make just by striking up a conversation in a park or at the beach.\n\nAnd these aren’t just young backpacker types who are eager to host. As I was using a free grill at an Australian park, I met a man in his 70’s (with a gorgeous wife in her 50’s!) who invited me to stay at his home in northern Tasmania so that I could watch his town’s annual penny-farthing competition.\n\n(A penny farthing is one of those bicycles with a huge front wheel and a tiny back wheel. Apparently there’s a small town in Tasmania that dedicates an entire weekend to competitive penny farthing races.)\n\nI had never heard of a penny farthing before I met him, but how can you say no to a guy in plaid suspenders and a bow-tie? I spent a week with him and his wife, didn’t spend a penny (no pun intended!) that entire time, and created fantastic new friendships with his entire family.\n\nOf course, staying with people – either through formal venues like Couchsurfing or through informal venues like meeting 70-year-olds in a city park – only accounts for about 20 percent of my total accommodation. The rest of the time, I’d stay in hostels (in Europe or South America) or in guesthouses (in Asia).\n\nDuring the times I traveled alone countries that only offer guesthouses (guesthouses sell private rooms, which are pricier than shared hostel rooms), I’d keep my eyes peeled for another female solo traveler. After some small talk, I’d ask her to be my roommate.\n\nDuring my first trip to Thailand (I’ve since returned 5 times), I randomly met – and became insta-friends – with a British girl who rode to the islands on the same boat that I did. We roomed together, traveled together for a few weeks, and to this day — years and years later — we still keep tabs on each other through Facebook.\n\nIn other words, the more you travel, the more friends you make worldwide. And the more your friends are scatted across the globe, the more you’re able to travel. It’s a self-perpetuating cycle. You simply have to launch it.\n\n#4: How Else Did You Cut Expenses?\n\nWe’ve covered lodging costs pretty thoroughly by now.\n\nAdmission to Tourist Spots – My litmus test is: “Will I regret NOT going here?”\n\nThe Taj Mahal had a $20 admission fee and it was worth every penny. The temple relics of Bagan in Burma, the ancient ruins of Angkor Wat, the Komodo dragons of Indonesia, the Van Gogh museum in the Netherlands, the all-day boat to the Great Barrier Reef, the site of Jesus’ crucifixion – these are absolutely worth the admission fee.\n\nBut some random museum for yet another obscure artist I’ve never heard of? No thanks.\n\nTransportation – I took one trip (Denver to Spain) through frequent flyer miles. The rest of the time, when I had to fly (which was rarely), I used local airlines. In Europe, RyanAir and Easyjet are the cheapest carriers. In Asia, I used AirAsia – they offer a $99 ticket from London to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nOccasionally I’d encounter “hiccups” that would cost me dearly. Last June when hundreds of pilots went on strike, I ended up stranded in Colombia and scrambled to buy a last-minute emergency ticket. But if frugality is a habit, you’ll have a “cushion” to cover these costs.\n\nFood – The only time I ate at a fancy restaurant was on my birthday. The rest of the time, I ate in small cafes and roadside stalls.\n\nI stopped eating meat in many places where I traveled, mostly for sanitary reasons. As an unintended consequence, this saved me a lot of money, as well.\n\nI also limited my alcohol consumption, especially in Muslim countries where there’s a hefty sin tax on beer. Lots of travelers spend tons of cash on booze, then complain that they can’t afford to do something awesome like scuba-diving.\n\nHow Much Does Maintaining a Rental Property Cost?\n\n \n\nHow did you come up with the your maintenance cost estimate? I would expect much higher on such a large and old house. You’re probably familiar with the commonly used “50% rule” which states you should prepare for total operating costs to be 50% of your rents. If that’s the case, you’re severely underfunded.\n\nThere are dozens of “rules of thumb” to predict how much you’ll spend on a rental property.\n\nThe 50% Rule states that all your operating costs – such as property tax, insurance, repairs, maintenance, water and trash service – will equal half of your rental income. Anything that’s left over either goes to the bank – to repay your mortgage – or goes to your pocket.\n\nIt’s a popular rule, and it’s one that I completely ignore.\n\nThe 50% Rule is based on a variable – the rent – that has absolutely zero relationship to your operating costs. Regardless of what I charge for rent, the rest of my bills — water, trash, insurance and taxes — remain the same.\n\nAs a landlord you realize the arbitrary nature of rent. Here’s how rent pricing works: You pick a number out of thin air, advertise it as ‘rent’ and see if anyone bites.\n\n(Okay, it’s not exactly like that. You study the area to see what other places are renting for. But that relates more to cyclical market demand than it does to the cost of dishwashers.)\n\nIf no one wants the space, you lower the rent. If people flood your Inbox, you take down the ad, raise the price, and re-post the ad.\n\nI’m oversimplifying. I toured about two dozen rental units in my neighborhood to get an idea of what the competition charges – so the number I set as the rent wasn’t completely out of “thin air.” But ultimately the difference between charging $700 or $800 per month boils down to a combination of market indicators and my personal confidence.\n\nLet’s imagine Angelina Jolie just announced she’s moving to the neighborhood, so everyone wants to live here. I raise the rent $100 on each of the two single-bedroom units and $200 on the three-bedroom unit. That’s an increase of $4,800 a year.\n\nAccording to the 50% Rule, my predicted “operating costs” should jump by half of that, or by $2,400 a year. But that doesn’t make sense. There’s no relationship between rent and costs.\n\nTo put it simply: You charge what the free market allows you to charge. You spend what you’re forced to spend. The two are not related.\n\nThat’s why I refuse to sign a contract with any Realtor who gives me a line such as: “Well, I don’t know what the average water bill is, but if it’s high you can just raise the rent to make up for it.”\n\nHogwash. The free market sets the rent, and the market doesn’t care what my water bill is.\n\nTo go back to the beginning of the question – how did I arrive at my operating cost estimates? There are a few ways to do it:\n\n#1: You could take the cost of items that deteriorate over time – a dishwasher, a roof, the water heater, the insulation in the attic – and “spread” that cost, or “amortize” it, to estimate how much you’d pay per year. For example: bathtubs need to be replaced every 12-15 years, so the bathtub’s price per year is X divided by 13 or 14.\n\n#2: You also assume about 5-10 percent of the rental price as the cost of hiring a property manager – since managers do, in fact, often tie their costs to the rental price. (It’s an incentive for them to increase the rent).\n\n#3: DON’T count upfront one-time expenses that are a result of buying a fixer-upper. Maintenance costs will recur forever. Upfront repair costs are part of the “purchase price.”\n\n#4: There’s a rule-of-thumb that says your “maintenance” costs (new paint, new carpet, etc.) are 1 percent of the purchase price per year. I’m dubious about the correlation, but that rule-of-thumb sounds more reasonable than the 50 percent rule.\n\nBefore you make any purchase, read this article that explains how to calculate the Cap Rate and the Cash-on-Cash Return.\n\nHow Do You Afford Health Care While Traveling?\n\n \n\n“What do you do for health care every time you move to each country? Is there a US health care that travels with you? Or do you get the local health care each time?”\n\nI purchased traveler’s health insurance, which mandates — as part of its eligibility requirements — that I must be outside the US or Canada for at least 6 months out of every year. The insurance had a very high deductible, somewhere in the neighborhood of $2,000 or $3,000, so conceptually it was a worst-case-scenario, “if-I-get-hit-by-a-bus” insurance.\n\nThat said, health care in many other countries is top-notch and far less expensive than it is in the U.S. My boyfriend and I both received amazing health care in Thailand.\n\nMy treatments were routine — I visited the dentist, sat for an eye exam and filled a new contact lens prescription.\n\nHis treatment was much more complex. He asked a Thai dentist to extract all his mercury teeth fillings and replace with them with gold fillings — a process that required many, many dentist visits over a two week span. (He hated the idea of having mercury, a toxin, embedded in his teeth.)\n\nThis extraction in the U.S. would have cost several thousand dollars. In Bangkok, it cost $400 — literally a fraction of its price here at home.\n\nMany doctors and dentists overseas are fantastic. It’s normal to be scared of the unknown, but this fear might hold you back. Many foreign doctors attend U.S., Australian or British medical schools before returning to their native Thailand, Peru or India.\n\nLow health-care costs abroad have created a large “medical tourism” industry that caters to people who fly overseas specifically for the sake of medical treatment. These aren’t sick or injured travelers; these are Westerners who fly overseas for the sole purpose of finding good-value health care.\n\nAs a result, there’s an abundance of international hospitals filled with English-speaking staff.\n\nAWESOME TIP: Want to recognize a sign that a countries’ hospitals hold high international esteem? Look at where the leaders of other nations travel for medical treatment. Many Nepalese diplomats and heads of state helicopter to Bangkok for their medical care.\n\nShould People Walk Out on Their Debt?\n\n \n\nAre you encouraging people to walk away from debt… underground mortgages and credit cards? That actually wasn’t clear to me. I was waiting for you to say how you could use the psychological trick of forgetting to pay debt down painlessly.\n\nI was a little unnerved by the post, but then I thought about all the hard working middle class folks who have these kinds of debts… and how they’d benefit from it… and big banks would suffer, slightly. Happy dance!!\n\nI will say, not mentioning the financial consequences on your credit makes it feel like an incomplete piece, like I was unsold on the idea… but only for this reason. Like, what happens to me once I’m wealthier and want to get a business loan to start a bakery or something like that?\n\nAh, great question. Here’s my reply:\n\nNope, I didn’t mean that at all. I’m suggesting “Forget Your Debt” as a strategy for paying off your debt.\n\nThe “Forget Your Debt” strategy is a mental shift: Stop thinking of yourself as someone trapped in a hole that you desperately need to claw your way out of. Start thinking of yourself as a person — a free person — who wants to build wealth.\n\nSaving money on interest payments (by repaying your loans) is one of many great ways to build wealth. Compare your interest rate to the returns you can achieve by investing your money elsewhere. It’s likely that you’ll decide that repaying your debt in its entirety is what your wealth-building strategy should target first.\n\nOf course, if you have low-interest debt (like a very low-interest student loan, a low-interest mortgage, or a zero-interest payment plan to a hospital), you might strategically decide to make only the minimum payment, so you can invest your money elsewhere.\n\nThe mental trick is to shift from thinking about “climbing out of debt” to thinking about “saving as a means to building wealth.”\n\nThe debt mindset can make you feel imprisoned. You won’t get very far if your goal is simply to “get to zero.”\n\nThe wealth-building mindset can make you like a free agent who has a pro-active goal to build infinite wealth (or a million dollars, or whatever your goal is). Repaying your debt is simply one piece of the bigger picture.\n\nHow Do You Afford Your Lifestyle?\n\n \n\nI would like to know more about HOW you were able to do what you did. I think it’s fantastic, but the articles I find don’t really go into the details in order for someone else to follow in your footsteps. I assume that’s what your coaching sessions cover.\n\nYou mention “following in my footsteps.” I discourage that. I’m here to guide and inspire you to blaze your own path. Don’t follow in anyone’s footsteps — not even mine.\n\nI built my choices around specific priorities that many others won’t share. For example: I wanted to travel for at least 2 years without any employment (not even self-employment).\n\nNot everyone shares this vision. Some people love the idea of teaching ski lessons in the Alps or teaching sailing lessons in Hawaii. They don’t share my goal of job-free travel. Other people want a mini-retirement, but think 2 years sounds like a long time to be unemployed.\n\nMy readers dream of doing many incredible things: launching a business, adopting 5 babies or retiring at 50.\n\nSo follow your own path — don’t follow mine. I’m just here to guide and inspire; the vision comes from within you.\n\nThat said, here’s how I achieved my dream of traveling for two years (I ended up on the road for two-and-a-half) without income:\n\nI worked part-time for 2 years and full-time for 2 years with this SPECIFIC goal at the forefront of my mind during that entire time.\n\nI saved 15% of my pretax income in a retirement account. Retirement always comes first.\n\nI lived on $1,000 a month in Boulder, Colo. The rent on my studio apartment was $450 per month, including utilities. Groceries tallied $150. The other $400 went towards my cell phone, doctor’s co-pays, contact lenses, my snowboard, miscellaneous stuff from Target … you know, the stuff of life.\n\nIn the spring, summer and fall, I cancelled my car insurance and bicycled everywhere.\n\nI didn’t have a pet, even though I wanted one. I didn’t get highlights in my hair, even though I wanted them. I didn’t buy Odwalla Superfood juice, even though I loved it. In short: I sacrificed ‘small’ indulgences.\n\nI didn’t have a television or internet. In fact, I didn’t even have a computer. I used the computer at work for personal errands — my boss didn’t mind because I stayed late and did it on my “own time.”\n\nI worked a second job in the evenings. In the beginning, I delivered newspapers. That’s right: I would write for the newspaper during the day, and deliver the newspaper at night. Later, I moved onto writing freelance articles for magazines.\n\nHere’s the rub: I don’t recommend this extreme-frugality lifestyle. It’s tough. I did it because I was motivated by a HUGE dream. But if you’re not compelled by a big dream, then that kind of extreme-frugality can create burnout.\n\nWhat if I Can’t Hit One Percent?\n\nMany of my readers are rental property investors (or aspiring investors). But not all of them live in “cheap locations.”\n\nSeveral readers have asked what how to invest if they live in a place where houses don’t meet the One Percent Rule.\n\n“My question is about your 1 percent rule for rental housing. What do you think about that rule when applied to the high-cost area where we live?\n\n“(We expect) to have a 3-4 bedroom house that’s worth $650,000 – $750,000 (after renovations) that we rent for $3,200 – $4,000. We may not make much on rental income, but we would be growing a nest egg in the value of the resale of the house down the road — be it 5-10 years down the road.\n\n“We’re curious on your thoughts.”\n\nI crunched the numbers at the low end of the range — $3,200/mo gross income on a house valued at $650,000. I assume you net 70 percent of the monthly income after expenses (although that’s a generous assumption — the industry rule-of-thumb is that you’d net 50 percent).\n\nYou’ll net $2,240/mo, or $26,880 a year. Your cap rate is 26,880/650,000 = 0.041, or 4.1 percent.\n\nHistorically, homes nationwide have appreciated at a long-term annualized average of about 3-5 percent.\n\nYour city, Arlington, VA, has appreciated at an annual rate of 3.9 percent since 1990, according to Neighborhood Scout.\n\nIt looks like the return you’ll get is about 4 percent, based on historic long-term appreciation in your area.\n\nThat means this deal isn’t worth your time.\n\nWhat should you do? Here are two options:\n\n#1: Dedicate a significant amount of time scouting out the best deals. You just need one super-undervalued property to make your personal numbers substantially better than the general average. You can beat the average in rental properties if you buy the right house.\n\n#2: Look outside of Arlington. Imagine a bunch of concentric circles on a map, with your hometown as the epicenter. If there’s nothing that meets the One Percent Rule in your hometown, expand your search to the next ring. Then the next one. And then the next one.\n\nI lived in Boulder, Colorado for 8 years. I never found anything in Boulder that meets the One Percent Rule. But when I expand outward to a small city called Broomfield, Colo., I can find plenty of rentals that meet the One Percent Rule.\n\nAlso: Many people who read Afford Anything (mistakenly) think that Atlanta is an awesome place to invest. But you must realize that when I talk about “metro Atlanta,” I’m referring to a place that has a population of 5.2 million people. That’s eight times more populous than Vermont. It’s a bigger population than the entire state of Colorado.\n\nAtlanta isn’t a one-size-fits-all market. I can’t paint such a massive metro area with one giant brush.\n\nSure, there are some pockets of metro Atlanta — like east of Panthersville, Georgia — where I can buy a foreclosed home for $21,000. But there are other areas in Atlanta where a 1000-sq.-ft. condo sells for $450,000. Location, location, location.\n\nIf I only looked at my own backyard, my quest to meet the One Percent Rule would be a lot harder. I put that in bold because this is a crucial lesson. Almost everyone who emails me, looking for permission to be the “exception” to the One Percent Rule, cites the reasoning that there’s nothing in their backyard that meets that requirement. Well, guess what: There’s nothing in my own backyard that fits the One Percent Rule, either. That’s why I expanded my search outward, in bigger and bigger concentric rings, until I found neighborhoods that have properties that fit this rule.\n\n(It took me a year of fruitless searches to figure this out. Here’s the ah-ha story that I wrote when I did. Learn from my mistake; you’ll save time.)\n\nBy expanding outward, I can find better deals — and so can you. Keep looking. Don’t give up.\n\nWhat Did You Do With Your Stuff When You Traveled?\n\n \n\n“Hi! You’ve inspired me so much with your drive to be “location independent.” I was just curious about one thing: Did you sell your home in order to travel? Or did you have your own place to come home to?”\n\nFor the sake of saving money, I didn’t have a home … or anything else.\n\nI sold almost everything I owned, including my car and furniture. I sold some stuff for hundreds of dollars, and other things in $20 increments. All the money went towards my travel fund.\n\nAnything I couldn’t sell, I donated to Goodwill or the Humane Society thrift store. The few possessions that remained, like my snowboard, I stored with friends.\n\nI had been renting, so I timed my departure to coincide with the end of my lease. In the span of one week, I quit my job, moved out of my apartment, and flew to Spain with a one-way ticket.\n\nOf course, I knew I’d be traveling for 2+ years. If I had only been going away for 6 months, I would have acted differently.\n\nIf I had owned a home, I would have placed a tenant in it and hired a property manager to oversee the building. In fact, I know a woman who has a handful of rentals in Atlanta, but lives in Paris. Her property manager sends her a check every month, which she spends on bicycles and clothes and croissants and whatever else people buy in France. ☺\n\nIf you’re a homeowner, and you lived by The One Percent Rule when you bought your house, you’re in a much stronger position to travel than renters are. Renting out your home is the fastest and most surefire way to retire young, travel anywhere, and live free.\n\nHow Do You Lead Tenants from “Showing” to “Move-In”?\n\n \n\n“I have two rentals, and my own home. I love reading about real estate investing, but the thing I have the most problem with … (is) getting people from a showing, to tenancy. Could you write about your process? What info do you give them at the showing? What questions do you ask them? What credit/background check service you use?”\n\nI have the same problem. I’ll do a showing for prospective tenants. The potential tenant “oohs” and “ahhhs” about the high ceilings and big backyard. They start mentally placing their furniture throughout the house – “My couch would look great here! I can put my table there!” – which is a fantastic sign.\n\nThen I never hear from them again. They never fill out an application. So what do I do?\n\nNothing. If they’re not on-the-ball enough to fill out an application, I don’t want them as a tenant.\n\nBesides, if they really wanted to live there, they’d apply.\n\nAs for the second part of your question, regarding tenant screening: I use TransUnion MySmartMoveas a tenant screening service. It allows you to view their credit score and their criminal history.\n\n(By the way, that is NOT an affiliate link or any kind of paid promotion. That’s just what I genuinely use.)\n\nI also call their current/previous landlord and get a copy of their pay stub. If they live in an apartment building, look up the phone number of the building yourself rather than dialing the number they gave you. Plenty of tenants have their friends pose as a fake “ex-landlord” reference.\n\nShould bad credit nix the applicant? Sometimes.\n\nOne of my best tenants had perfect credit except for a foreclosure. The foreclosure tanked his credit score, but I noticed that he paid all his other bills – credit cards, car loans, etc. – on time. His income was almost four times the monthly rent. So despite his low credit score, I let him move in, and he’s been a perfect tenant ever since.\n\nOf course, your results may vary. This is a judgment call. You have to make your own decisions.\n\nThree More Essential Tenant Tips\n\nOne of my readers, Karen, emailed me the following tenant screening tips. I liked these so much that I asked her if I could share them with AA readers:\n\n#1: Peep Their Ride.\n\nThe MOST important other thing to do is look inside their car when they come to see the rental. You will see their attitude towards their surroundings. The way they keep the inside of the car is the way they will keep your premises.\n\nIf the car is old, but clean as a whistle, they take care of their possessions and will most likely keep your rental the same way. If the car floor is knee-deep in fast food wrappers, soiled baby diapers, garbage, empty beverage cans, discarded clothes, this is how they will keep your home. Their attitude towards their surroundings is poor. They will also most likely refuse to pay for – or even acknowledge – their damages.\n\n#2: Visit Their Home.\n\nIf they live in town, visit their home. The way their home is is the way they will keep YOUR place.\n\nHow can you see their home? You can drop by to give them information. You can arrange to sign the lease there. (You’ll still have time to back out if you see that they’ve trashed it!)\n\nBy visiting their home, you will also find out if they have pets. This will be especially important if your lease specifies “no pets.” (Incidentally I never allow pets, especially dogs. When the tenant’s dog bites someone, YOU will be sued. The tenant will get off scot-free, as they have no assets which can be taken in the judgement.)\n\nPets also leave fleas, tear up carpets, damage woodwork, bark constantly, and defecate in and out of the house (which irresponsible pet owners don’t clean.) Your insurance company will love you if you don’t take pets, especially large dogs.\n\n#3: Use Google Voice (or an Answering Machine).\n\nI use an answering machine for calls. If the prospective tenant is speaking over the sound of shrieks and howls and commotion — if they sound like they’re calling from the raptor house at the zoo — you most likely will not find them to be good tenants.\n\nOne day I heard two calls on the answering machine. One was from a man who said: “Hello, this is Dennis. I’m a heavy equipment operator for XYZ Construction Company and I’ve worked there for 3 years. I work 6 days a week, and I’m gone from 6 AM until 6 PM every day. I have my pay stubs to prove how much I earn. My boss will give me a reference.”\n\nThe second call said, “Yo. I needs the place. Welfare gives me some money and I live with my Daddy. He won’t let my homies hang at his place. Welfare says they give me mo money if I has my own place. Then my homies can hang at my pad.”\n\nWhen you use answering machine, you can pre-screen. You don’t have to bother calling back the tenants that don’t sound like good candidates. (And if they imply that they’ll be using your place as a party pad, paid on the taxpayer dime, they might not be the tenants you want.)\n\nThe reader who contributed these comments, Karen, has been a landlord for more than 20 years. Karen says: “At one time I had 54 tenants simultaneously in addition to my regular business, and I have always been a successful owner of rental property.”\n\nHow Do You Estimate Repairs on a Property?\n\n \n\nI have a long list of repairs and upgrades which my house needs, and I would like to find an impartial source for ballpark price estimates. What do you recommend?\n\nThose estimates will vary, depending on what part of the country you live in. Labor rates and materials cost different amounts in different regions.\n\nFurthermore, the costs will vary depending on the scope of work, complexity of the job and the seriousness of the existing damage. Installing large tiles on a non-level flooring surface, for instance, will cost much more than installing tile on a level floor.\n\nYou can check a website like Angie’s List for recommendations, but honestly, I would collect three or four quotes from each subcontractor. That should give you a good, representative sample of how much labor and materials for each project cost in your specific area.\n\nShould You Buy Properties From a Wholesaler?\n\n \n\nWhat do you think about buying from a company that sells houses to investors?\n\nHere’s my take: there are plenty of people who will flip houses to other investors. They’re called wholesalers, and like with any other industry, you’ll find honest wholesalers as well as shady wholesalers. However, if you’re not familiar with the area/city, or if you’re new to real estate investing, you may be at a higher risk for falling victim to shady wholesalers.\n\nPlus, the stakes are higher. Fall victim to a shady dry-cleaner or tailor, and at worst you’ve lost the cost of your jacket. Fall victim to a shady wholesaler, and you’ve lost tens of thousands.\n\nThat said, I think investing in a different state is a great option for people who live in expensive areas where not many houses meet the One Percent Rule.\n\nIf I were you, I’d take a trip to Atlanta or Memphis (or whatever city you were thinking about investing in). You can learn a lot by driving around, eating at local cafes, hanging out at coffee shops, and generally getting a “feel” for the area. You can also meet local property managers.\n\nBeyond that, I’d get an inspector to check out the house before you buy it. This costs about $300 to $500 and it’s worth every dime. You don’t want to be blindsided. I’d also get an appraisal done, another $300 to $500 expense that can reduce the risk that you’re overpaying for a property.\n\nDon’t believe the numbers that the seller gives you. If the seller says that he paid $2,000 last year in utilities, don’t just take his word for it — demand to see the bills. If the seller says the taxes on the house are $5,400 a year, demand to see the tax records.\n\nAnd never, ever, EVER trust the seller’s “cap rate” or “cash-on-cash return” numbers. Many sellers inflate those numbers by pretending that the home has 100 percent occupancy and free property management. Do the math yourself.\n\nIf you have a good team in place (property manager, inspector, appraiser, contractor), you can be a successful out-of-town investor. Just don’t believe everything the seller says. Trust, but verify.\n\nI’m Upside-Down on My Home. Should I Rent It Out? Or Sell It?\n\nAn Afford Anything reader recently emailed me about this dilemma:\n\nHe’s upside-down on his home. He owes more than the house is worth.\n\nBut he wants to take advantage of today’s low housing prices, which will let him move his daughter into the best school district in town. He can put 10 percent down on a new house in a fantastic school district.\n\nHe’d lose money if he sold his current home. There are only two ways he can sell it: either bring cash to the closing table (i.e. pay extra to get rid of it!) or process an excruciating short sale, which would destroy his credit.\n\nBoth of those choices are off the table. He wants to rent out his current home until the market recovers enough that he can sell it. But is this a good idea?\n\nCheck out the details:\n\nMONTHLY INCOME\n\nRent: $1,600\n\nMONTHLY EXPENSES\n\nMortgage + Association Payment: $1,200\n\nVacancy: $100 *\n\nRepairs, Maintenance: $50 – $100 **\n\nProperty Manager: $100\n\nTotal Expenses: $1,450\n\nThis leaves him with $100 – $150 per month in cash flow.\n\nHold On, Where Did You Get Those Vacancy / Maintenance Numbers?\n\nIf the house is vacant one month per year, we can average that out to a monthly vacancy cost of $100. Of course, if it sits vacant for 3-5 months, he’ll be sweating.\n\nThe “rule of thumb” is that maintenance will cost 1 percent of the purchase price of the house. Of course, that’s a long-term annualized average. It includes rare, expensive repairs like replacing the roof every 20-25 years and re-painting the siding every 5 years.\n\nSince he has an association payment, I assume his homeowner’s association takes care of all exterior maintenance. That brings his maintenance costs down. (Well, really, it just lumps his maintenance costs into a different category).\n\nAssuming his house is in good condition, his big maintenance costs will rare but costly events like replacing the water heater, buying a new refrigerator, etc. He won’t literally pay $100 every month. Like his vacancy costs, this maintenance cost is a long-term average over the span of many years.\n\nHe reported a property management fee of $100 per month in the email that he sent me. That seems rather cheap (it’s only 6 percent of the rent), but some property managers will charge a cheaper fee in a neighborhood with higher tenant quality, so I’ll accept that premise at face value. (Some property managers charge one month’s rent as a “placement fee” for finding a tenant, which is NOT included here.)\n\nSo What Do You Recommend?\n\nHere’s my advice:\n\n#1: Use your $100 – $150 monthly cash flow to build some cash reserves. Use this to cover the mortgage payments when your house sits vacant. Vacancy is your single biggest risk, because you’ll have to cough up the cash for two mortgages (your rental house and the home you live in). Strong cash reserves are the single biggest weapon you have against this risk.\n\n#2: Add even more money to those cash reserves so that you can quickly write checks for repairs and maintenance. What if the house sits vacant for 4 months, a tenant moves in, and a week later you need to call a plumber? Cash reserves will help you sleep better at night.\n\n#3: Don’t even think about making “extra” mortgage payments before you have huge cash reserves built.\n\nI’d recommend a minimum cash reserve of 6 months of mortgage payments, and an optimal cash reserve of 8 to 10 months. That way, if you deal with an extended vacancy, you’ll be able to cover the mortgage.\n\nMany landlords “shoot themselves in the foot” by panicking about a vacancy and renting out their home to the first willing tenant that comes along — even if their gut instinct says it might not be a good tenant. That always leads to disaster.\n\nIf you have cash reserves to deal with a vacancy, you can take your time and wait for the right tenant — a good tenant — instead of accepting the first person who’s willing to move in.\n\nOne of my houses has been vacant for almost three months. (It’s the $21,000 foreclosure, which is in a part of town that doesn’t always attract — um — the most qualified candidates). I’m guessing that the house might sit vacant for four or five months before I get someone in there.\n\nBut here’s the thing: Several people said they’re interested in moving in. But none of them have met my tenant criteria. It’s nice to be able to hold out and wait, so that you’ll eventually get the right tenant, not the first one.\n\nShould I Buy a House With Cash?\n\n \n\nIn my area, I can buy a quality house/duplex for $45,000 – $100,000.\n\nMy partner and I want to get a house with great rentability. We’ll live in it for 4 years while I finish graduate school, at which point we’ll move.\n\nWe hope to keep the place – as a rental property — indefinitely.\n\nMy question is: Are we better off buying a 100% cash purchase that will give us less rental income? Or are we better off financing a property that is more expensive, and will give us higher rental income?\n\nYou can’t look at investments in a vacuum. You need to frame the invest within the context of your life.\n\nYou’re about to enter a 4-year graduate school program. That means you won’t be earning much income, and you’ll be spending a lot of your time on non-income-producing work.\n\nGiven your grad-student status, I’d make an all-cash purchase right now.\n\nAfter you graduate and you and your partner are both working full-time, you can think about increasing your leverage. But while you’re in school, stick with the option that will free your mental space and maximize your flexibility.\n\nThat said, let me add two more points:\n\n#1: Cash Reserves\n\nI don’t know how much money you have set aside for emergencies – such as car repairs, home repairs, and covering your cost-of-living if you can’t find work. I’m assuming that you already have decent reserves built.\n\nBuilding a cash reserve comes first, before everything else.\n\nIf you have to take out a very small mortgage (e.g. plunk down an 80 percent down payment and finance a small piece of the house) for the sake of preserving your emergency fund, go ahead and do it. It’s more important to have a strong emergency fund than it is to be mortgage-free but have $0 in cash reserves.\n\nWhy? Let’s say that you’re mortgage-free, but you have zero savings. Suddenly, your heater breaks. In the middle of winter. In Minnesota.\n\nSuddenly, you’re on-the-hook for paying for a very expensive (and urgent) repair. If you don’t have cash reserves, you’ll be forced to charge it on a credit card — with a double-digit interest rate. Yikes!\n\nFeel free to take out a mortgage in order to protect your cash reserves. Think of your mortgage as a “cheap insurance” policy that will protect you from sliding into credit card debt.\n\nSpeaking of which …\n\n#2: High-Interest Debt\n\nSince we’re chatting about buying a house in cash, I’m assuming that you don’t have any high-interest debt, such as a credit card. If you have a dime of debt, I’m assuming it’s ultra-low-interest (e.g. lower than a typical mortgage).\n\nIf that assumption is wrong … friggin’ pay off your debt. That’s Priority Number One. Build a teeny-tiny cash reserve (about $1,000) and then devote every dime to paying off your high-interest debt.\n\nAssuming you’re debt-free and you have solid cash reserves, shoot for the all-cash rental property purchase. And enjoy grad school!\n\nShould You Buy a Vacation Rental?\n\nUPDATE, 2016: I wrote this article before I started my own vacation rental business: renting an apartment on Airbnb.\n\nI hosted 55 guests and earned $28,268.35 in my first year as an Airbnb host.\n\nI documented and detailed everything — with total transparency around the income and expenses — in a massive four-part series, which you can read here.\n\nI recommend checking out that series and downloading this free PDF guide if you’d like to learn more about investing in a vacation rental.\n\nIn the meantime, here’s the original answer below, explaining my ideas about vacation rental ownership before I dove into the scene. Feel free to read it and laugh at me. 🙂\n\n“You talk a lot about rental property — but focus on tenants with traditional long-term leases.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on vacation property. Is this a worse/better investment? Short-term rentals at a premium price during a vacation season? Would you consider this a riskier proposition?”\n\nRenting out a vacation home is one step away from running a hotel.\n\nYour customers expect things that normal tenants would never ask a landlord for: clean towels, rolls of toilet paper, organized kitchenware. You’ll spend a lot more time responding to customer requests, cleaning during the “turnover” period, and scheduling check-ins and check-outs.\n\nPeople will contact you to ask about availability, amenities, location, pet policy and other questions. A fraction of those people will decide to reserve the home, which means you’ll need to take a deposit (“Yes, we accept Visa”) and send them reservation paperwork. You’ll need to schedule the cleaning crew. You’ll also need to provide furnishings: couches, beds, tables.\n\nThe customers will call you at midnight to say their GPS can’t find the location, or the key isn’t at the designated spot, or to ask how to operate the thermostat. They’ll write reviews on Yelp saying the wireless internet is too slow or that the floorboards creak. You’re also likely to endure higher vacancy rates. And in the rental world, nothing is more expensive than vacancy.\n\nYou can hire property managers to handle the day-to-day hassles, but they’ll charge a LOT more than “normal” property managers. Many will ask for 50 percent of your income, and that rate is reasonable, since they handle so much more turnover and so many more responsibilities.\n\nTreat Your Business Like a Business\n\nDo I sound like a pessimist yet? That’s intentional.\n\nWhen you’re contemplating an investment, start with healthy skepticism. Assume it WON’T make money and try to prove yourself wrong. This helps you avoid a massive mental trap: confusing ‘hopeful thinking’ with a business plan.\n\nBut now that we’ve practiced healthy skepticism, let’s move onto the pluses –\n\nVacation rentals (and their close cousin, extended-stay hotels) can be lucrative, if you buy the right place at the right price and manage it well. But I wouldn’t call it an “investment.” I’d call it a “business.”\n\n“Uh, Paula, businesses are investments.”\n\nYes, but not all investments are businesses.\n\nSome investments are totally passive. Just buy some S&amp;P 500 Index Funds and ride the bull-market wave! Wheee!\n\nOther investments, like owning rental properties, are akin to managing a business. You schedule inspections. You hire and fire plumbers. You spend an afternoon installing blinds. Even with a manager in place, you’re still the Chairman and CEO.\n\nAnd that’s fine, because index funds and rental properties are two totally different ballgames. Just be aware of the differences from the first inning. Many businesses fail because of neglect.\n\nHere’s the thing: If you want to quit your day job and run a business, you could enter the vacation rental field. Or start an ice-cream shop. Or open a pet food store. And you’d have to do all the due diligence related to the viability of that business in your place and time.\n\nIf the math works out, and you’re willing to put in the effort – go for it! Live like no one else for a while, so you can reap massive rewards.\n\nBut if you just want to own a beach house that collects rent when you’re not around, I’d seriously think twice.\n\nYour Vacation is Not Your Business\n\nI recently talked my parents out of owning a vacation rental. They wanted to buy a condo in Florida.\n\n“We’ll vacation two or three months a year, and rent it out when we’re not there! The rent will cover most of the expenses! And maybe it’ll go up in value!”\n\nI slapped my forehead. They were expressing code words for: “I don’t have a strategy. I want it all.”\n\n“You’re waayyy better off buying a house in DeKalb County, Georgia, collecting an annual rent of 20 – 33 percent of its total purchase price, and using those profits to take a vacation,” I told them.\n\nThey were committing the classic error of emotional investing. They wanted to “feel better” about their vacation condo by thinking: “It pays for itself!”\n\nBut hope is not a plan.\n\nWhy Do You Want It?\n\nSo … are you looking at a vacation rental because:\n\n#1: You want to buy a vacation house, and you’d like the emotional satisfaction of having the house pay for itself?\n\n#2: You see a huge demand for short-term rentals, coupled with low rental supply and reasonable home purchase prices?\n\nIf your answer is number one, forget it. If your answer is number two, rock on! Awesome! Now we’ve got something to work with!\n\nThe next logical question is: After accounting for vacancies and management, which will take a HUGE chunk out of your bottom line, will you make more money on this property as a short-term/weekly rental, or as a long-term (traditional one-year-lease) rental?\n\nOnly a spreadsheet can answer that. Call a few property management companies to see what percentage of the rent they charge. Don’t assume you’ll go with the cheapest one. It’s better to hire a stellar manager than a doofus who you’ll have to micromanage.\n\nScout around on Craigslist, VRBO.com and airbnb.com to find the competition’s weekly rental rates. Poke around on Zillow and Trulia to discover purchase prices of homes.\n\nThen create a spreadsheet with three different scenarios, each containing different vacancy, maintenance and repair estimates. The answer will quickly become clear.\n\n \n\nAfford Anything"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:42:19.901434"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2396]]

(Seriously?) - Afford Anything\n\n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nAfford Anything\n\nJanuary 24, 2017Written By Paula Pant\n\nWhat if We Quit Setting Goals? (Seriously?)\n\nIt’s an old familiar hum:\n\nEvery January, we kickoff the calendar year with New Years Resolutions: lose 10 pounds, make smarter investments, create an extra $1,500 per month on the side.\n\nYet by February, we’ve returned to life as usual. The discarded New Years Resolution has become a tired cultural trope.\n\nWe blame ourselves for these failures:\n\n“I should work harder.”\n\n“I should be more disciplined.”\n\n“I should stop procrastinating.”\n\nBut what if we’re approaching this in the wrong way? What if goal-setting itself is the problem?\n\nSociety says goal-setting is as integral to life as food, sleep, and arguing with your GPS.\n\n“Dammit, Siri, I can’t turn left! That’s a one-way street!”\n\nI’ve set countless goals over the years; I’ve achieved some, fallen short at others, and exceeded a few. Yet I’ve also lived with constant, low-level anxiety about my ability to meet my own expectations.\n\nLately, as a thought experiment, I’ve started wondering what would happen if I gave up the practice of setting goals.\n\nWould I transform into a couch-and-potato-chips sloth, watching cartoons all afternoon? (Actually, that sounds kinda nice.) Or would I relax, and, paradoxically, accomplish more as a result?\n\nI don’t have all the answers, but I’d like to explore these questions. So today, let’s examine the downside of setting goals. We’ll define a “goal” as a specific future outcome (result) that a person or group tries to create.\n\nProblem #1: Goals harm intrinsic motivation.\n\nImagine your goal is to lose 10 pounds. You exercise daily, but you don’t enjoy your time at the gym. You grudgingly endure your workouts, while fantasizing about results.\n\nWhat are the chances that you’ll (#1) reach your goal, and (#2) maintain a lifelong exercise habit?\n\nNot likely.\n\nBut why?\n\nTo answer this, let’s look at two types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic.\n\nIntrinsic motivation is driven by enjoying the activity itself.\n\nExtrinsic motivation is driven by an outcome.\n\nIf you read books, play guitar, or hike for its own sake — with no expectation of reward — you’re intrinsically motivated.\n\nBut if you read books to appear smarter, play guitar to make money or attract dates, or hike to build muscle, you’re extrinsically motivated.\n\nIntrinsic motivation is more effective, research shows. Given the choice between rewards vs. enjoyment, you’re more likely to do stuff you love. For example, students who enjoy learning for its own sake — who are driven by curiosity and challenge — are more likely to remain life-long learners than students who are merely motivated to get a high G.P.A.\n\nMost of us structure our lives and businesses around getting results — “I want to make $500 per month on the side.”\n\nBut we’re happier and more productive when we focus on enjoying the activity itself — “I love the challenge of growing a small business.”\n\nLet’s return to our earlier example: your weight-loss goal and subsequent grudging-trips-to-the-gym.\n\nResearch shows (and workout enthusiasts know) that exercise is brimming with inherent benefits: lower stress, higher endorphins, better sleep. But if you’re preoccupied with the scale, you might overlook these intrinsic benefits. You’ve re-framed exercise as a means to an end, a delivery vehicle for results, rather than as an activity meant to be enjoyed for its own sake.\n\nYou’ve approached it with a results-based mindset (“what can I get from this?”), rather than an intrinsically-motivated mindset (“do I enjoy this?”) And ironically, you’re less likely to achieve and maintain results in the long-term.\n\nThe problem gets worse when we start tying “unnatural” rewards to an activity — like rewarding a trip to the gym with an indulgent hour of television.\n\nBestselling author Gretchen Rubin, in her book Better Than Before, uses this example:\n\n“If I tell [my daughter] that she can watch an hour of TV if she reads for an hour, I don’t build her habit of reading; I teach her that watching TV is more fun than reading.”\n\nTying an action to a reward is counterproductive.\n\nRubin, a guest on my podcast, pointed out another problem: goals and rewards create a “finish line.” This undermines the activity by framing it as temporary; it defines a stopping point. Sure, you’ll train for a marathon, but will you continue running once it’s over?\n\nProblem #2: Goals can make you miss the bigger picture.\n\nIn the 1960’s, Ford Motor Company noticed that small, inexpensive vehicles had begun booming in popularity.\n\nThey wanted to get on the bandwagon. (Is that a pun?)\n\nSo the company’s CEO declared an ambitious goal: by 1970, Ford would produce a vehicle that’s “under 2,000 pounds and under $2,000.” (That’s $12,559 in today’s dollars.)\n\nFord’s engineers and designers threw themselves into this project, and by September 1970, the company started production on its latest innovation: the Ford Pinto.\n\nThere was just one tiny problem.\n\nThe goal “under 2,000 pounds and under $2,000” was too specific; it didn’t address critical issues like quality or safety. The company’s management, distracted by their narrow goal, overlooked a serious design flaw related to the positioning of the fuel tank: the Pinto could ignite upon impact.\n\nAt least 53 people died in Ford Pinto fires, and in 1977, the Pinto became the largest product recall at that point in history.\n\nWhen Ford’s management focused on a goal that was too narrow and specific, they blinded themselves to the bigger picture.\n\nConventional wisdom says that goals ought to be S.M.A.R.T. — specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. For example:\n\n“I want to earn $10,000 per month by July.”\n\n“I want my business revenue to grow 15 percent by December.”\n\n“I want six-pack washboard abs by August.”\n\n“Under 2,000 pounds and under $2,000 by 1970” is a textbook S.M.A.R.T. goal — and on the surface, the team succeeded in reaching this goal.\n\nBut this implicitly relegated other qualities, like safety, to — um — the backburner. (Oohhh, no pun intended.)\n\n(Ouch, that’s terrible.)\n\nThe Ford Pinto case study, while an extreme example, is a cautionary tale: when we set specific goals, we narrow our attention — and therefore we risk overlooking something important.\n\n“Goals focus attention … This intense focus can blind people to important issues that appear unrelated to their goal,” wrote a team of researchers in a Harvard working paper, Goals Gone Wild. (Yes, that’s actually what they called the paper. Legit.)\n\n“… Consistent with the classic notion that you get what you reward, goal-setting may cause people to ignore important dimensions of performance …,” they wrote.\n\nIt’s easy for people (not just companies) to make the same mistake.\n\nWhen we commit to tight, specific goals — “I’m going to save $1,000 this month!” — we risk creating unintended consequences in other arenas.\n\nFor example, have you ever skimped on your health — e.g. eating cheap food like Ramen noodles, or skipping doctor’s visits, or not filling a prescription — for the sake of hitting your savings goal?\n\nHave you ever let friendships, sleep and exercise slide because you’re too focused on a work or business goal?\n\nYeah, me too.\n\n“What gets measured, gets done,” is a famous quote in management circles, but let’s remember its corollary: what doesn’t get measured gets overlooked.\n\nProblem #3: Fear interferes.\n\nI’ve been trying to write this article for two months.\n\nBut procrastination keeps getting in the way. I tell myself that I need to check email. Update Facebook. Buy cotton Q-tips on Amazon.\n\nThen I catch myself. I disconnect from wi-fi; I open my writing program. And … I suddenly need a snack.\n\nAt this rate, I’ll speak fluent Portuguese and hold a pilot’s license before I finish this damn article.\n\nIf I’m honest with myself, I’m procrastinating because I’m afraid of the outcome.\n\nWhat if nobody reads this article?\n\nWhat if people read it … but hate it?\n\nWhat if I’m a sucky writer?\n\nProcrastination is rooted in fear: fear of failure, fear of success, fear of change. These are rooted in developing an attachment to a specific outcome — another word for “goal.”\n\nAs Ray Williams writes in Psychology Today:\n\n“One inherent problem with goal-setting is related to how the brain works. Recent neuroscience research shows the brain works in a protective way, resistant to change. Therefore, any goals that require substantial behavioral change, or thinking-pattern change, will automatically be resisted.\n\n“The brain is wired to seek rewards and avoid pain or discomfort, including fear. When fear of failure creeps into the mind of the goal setter, it becomes a ‘demotivator,’ with a desire to return to known, comfortable behavior and thought patterns.”\n\nGoals trigger fear, and fear gets in the way of the work.\n\nFear interferes.\n\nIn this example:\n\nI created a goal: write a smart, funny article that my audience will love.\n\nI developed fear around any other possible alternative. (What if this article is not smart/funny/loved?)\n\nFear manifests as procrastination …\n\n… and this article lives in ‘draft’ mode for two months.\n\nAlternatively, what if I’d told myself:\n\nI’ll enjoy reading and writing about a fascinating topic.\n\nThen I’ll share that writing with the world.\n\nIf I gave up goal-setting, fear would become irrelevant.\n\nProblem #4: Goals make you dissatisfied with the present moment.\n\nOne final objection: Goals are built on the premise that now isn’t good enough.\n\nYou’ll be happy later — after you start earning more, after you quit your job, after you can live on your passive investment income.\n\nGoals fixate on the future. If you’re too goal-oriented, you risk missing the present moment; you live for the next milestone.\n\nAgain, I’m just exploring this idea. I’m not a card-carrying member of the Anti-Goal League; I’m not making definitive statements. But I’m intrigued enough by the idea of a goal-free existence that I decided to dedicate an article to exploring it.\n\nWe’ve outlined the objections above. Now what? Where do we go from here? If goals are flawed, what’s the better alternative? I scoured the Internet and found three options:\n\nAlternative #1: Abstinence\n\nYou could avoid goals entirely.\n\nThat’s the approach Zen Habits author Leo Babauta embraced, when he declared — (mostly) unambiguously — “I live mostly without goals.”\n\nHere’s how he describes goal-free living:\n\n“What do you do, then? Lay around on the couch all day, sleeping and watching TV and eating Ho-Hos? No, you simply do. You find something you’re passionate about, and do it.”\n\nHe says he plunges into activities — such as writing and teaching — without any specific goal in mind. He doesn’t have ‘sales goals’ for his books; he just writes.\n\nHmmm. I like that. But …\n\nMy self-identify as a Type A entrepreneur is kicking up serious resistance. I’m not ready for a goal-free existence. It’s too extreme of a leap — like a steak-and-seafood enthusiast suddenly turning vegan.\n\nWhat else is on the menu?\n\nAlternative #2: Moderation\n\nOn one hand, goals can narrow our focus, dampen our intrinsic motivation, and diminish our enjoyment of the present moment.\n\nOn the other hand, goals can inspire, motivate and improve our lives.\n\nMaybe, then, we don’t need to eradicate goals. We need to create better goals.\n\n“Just as doctors prescribe drugs selectively, mindful of interactions and adverse reactions, so too should managers carefully prescribe goals,” wrote the researchers in Goals Gone Wild.\n\nOkay, great. But how?\n\nAlternative #3: Re-Direction\n\nThis is the best answer I’ve discovered so far —\n\nFocus on actions, not results.\n\nInstead of: “My goal is to lose 10 pounds.”\n\nTry: “My goal is to exercise daily, cut back on sugar and alcohol, and eat more veggies.”\n\nIt’s a subtle difference, but in the latter example, you’re not trying to achieve any results.\n\nIf some natural consequence (like weight loss) stems from your actions, that’s fine — but that’s not the point.\n\nYou have no expectations, no self-imposed barometers. You’re only thinking about your actions. The results are outside of your control. You won’t be disappointed if a specific result doesn’t unfold; you won’t cross a ‘finish line’ if it does.\n\nHere’s why this is brilliant:\n\nCircle of Concern vs. Circle of Influence\n\nHere’s a circle.\n\nEverything you care about lives inside this circle — nuclear war, terrorism, sustainability, animal rights, the greying of your hair, your minor back pain, those scratches on your car, your investments, your income, augmented reality, colonizing Mars, whether or not artificial intelligence will kill us, and whether or not your socks match.\n\nIt’s quite a circle.\n\nStephen Covey, who introduced this concept in 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, calls this your “Circle of Concern.” Wallowing within your Circle of Concern creates blockage, resistance, fear. You can’t control these outcomes, so worrying is ineffective.\n\nInside of this, however, lives a smaller circle.\n\nThis circle only holds the concerns you can directly affect. This is your Circle of Influence.\n\nYou don’t hold much power or influence over Mars colonization and the future of artificial intelligence. You are, however, the CEO and Chairperson over your investment choices, your focus and effort at developing new skills, your hair color, and whether or not your socks match.\n\nIf you operate within your Circle of Influence, you’ll make the biggest impact. And the more you operate inside of this circle, the larger this circle grows over time.\n\nHow does this relate to goal-setting? Simply stated:\n\nYou cannot control results.\n\nI can create an online course, but I can’t control whether or not people are interested.\n\nI can create a podcast, but I can’t control whether or not people will listen.\n\nI can be kind to others, but I can’t control whether or not people will like me.\n\nResults are outside of your Circle of Influence. But actions are inside of your circle.\n\nI can create an amazing course. (Actions: outline, research, edit, edit, edit, tear up, re-write, edit.)\n\nI can prepare for the podcast. (Actions: research guests, prepare for interviews, etc.)\n\nI can be kind to others. (Actions: for starters, just don’t be a dick.)\n\nI can’t control the consequences. All I can do is act.\n\nThis brings us back to the original question: How can we apply this framework towards setting better goals?\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nInstead of: “My goal is to retire in 10 years.”\n\nTry: “My goal is to invest at least 50 percent of my income into index funds and rental properties.”\n\nInstead of: “My goal is to earn $X this year.”\n\nTry: “My goal is to identify three things that I’m doing that are a waste of time. Then I’d like to redirect this time to something more valuable.”\n\nInstead of: “My goal is to learn basic Spanish.”\n\nTry: “My goal is to use a Spanish language-learning app for at least 20 minutes a day.”\n\nInstead of: “My goal is to write a book.”\n\nTry: “My goal is to read and write from 9 am to 11 am.”\n\nThis is a low-stress approach. You cannot fear failure, because you’ve surrendered the results. Your only goal is to act.\n\nAs fear subsides, you’re more likely to quit procrastinating.

Preposterous. Outlandish. Nonsensical.\n\n(Somebody please take the thesaurus away from me.)\n\nLet’s chat about the “should I rent or buy?” question using logic, math and reason, rather than ill-informed clichés.\n\nBefore we jump in, let’s establish a few premises:\n\nThis article is about your primary residence (the place where you sleep).\n\nThis is not an article about real estate investing.\n\nAs with all articles on Afford Anything, these high-level concepts can be applied anywhere. But specifics about laws, taxes, inflation, etc., are geared at a United States audience.\n\nWith that said, let’s begin.\n\n“Renting is Throwing Money Away”\n\nHere are three popular arguments defending the “renting is throwing money away” myth.\n\n#1: Rent is an expense. Mortgages build equity.\n\n#2: Rent is forever. Mortgages end.\n\n#3: Renters don’t benefit from rising home values. Homeowners do.\n\nLet’s dismantle these, one-by-one.\n\nArgument #1: “Rent is an expense. Mortgages build equity.”\n\nHere’s the argument, broken down:\n\nIf you rent, 0% of your monthly payments build equity.\n\nIf you own, X% of your monthly payments build equity.\n\nX &gt; 0\n\nEquity is an asset.\n\nAssets are good.\n\nTherefore, owning is better than renting.\n\nHere’s why this is flawed logic.\n\nWhat is Home Equity?\n\nFirst, background information:\n\n“Home equity” is measured as what you own, minus what you owe.\n\nHome value: $350,000\n\nYou owe: $200,000\n\nYour equity: $150,000\n\nHere’s the rub: Only a small slice of your mortgage payment builds equity.\n\nYour mortgage consists of four parts:\n\nPrincipal (the equity-building piece)\n\nInterest\n\nTaxes\n\nInsurance\n\nThese are collectively called PITI, which leads to the geeky joke, “Mortgage? What a pity.” (I probably shouldn’t attempt a stand-up comedy career … )\n\nThe “P” is equity; the “ITI” is an expense. In other words, the “ITI” is money that you’re (also) “throwing away.”\n\nHow much of your monthly payment is consumed by ITI? Most of it, particularly during the first 15 years of your loan.\n\nMortgages are amortized, which means the overwhelming majority of your initial payments are applied towards interest rather than principal.\n\nLet’s look at an example of a $250,000 house. Let’s image the following scenario:\n\nYou make a $50,000 down payment.\n\nYou borrow $200,000.\n\nYou hold a 5 percent fixed-rate 30-year mortgage.\n\nProperty taxes cost $3,000 per year.\n\nHomeowners insurance costs $1,500 per year.\n\nNo mortgage insurance.\n\nYour mortgage payment comes to $1,448.64 per month.\n\nHow do these payments break down?\n\n[Thanks to my friend Todd Tresidder at the blog Financial Mentor for this awesome amortization calculator. Yes, I just used the word “awesome” to describe an amortization calculator. #ImNerdyAndIKnowIt ]\n\nDuring the first year, roughly 83 cents of every dollar goes towards interest, taxes and insurance (ITI) in this example.\n\nYou’re not building $1,448 in equity with each payment. You’re building $250 at best.\n\nAfter 13 payments, you’ll pay almost $15,000 in interest, taxes and insurance. ($14,795.71, to be exact.) And you’ll only hold an extra $2,963 in equity.\n\nYeowch.\n\nThe tipping point, when more money is applied to principal than interest, is based on your interest rate.\n\nDuring that first 13-19 years of your mortgage, you’re buried deep in the ITI sandbox. You’ll spend the final decade of your mortgage building far more equity than you did during the first two decades.\n\n“What if I get a 15-year mortgage?”\n\nYour first 7 years are going to suck.\n\nKey Takeaway: You’re not building much equity, especially during the first decade-and-a-half. Most of your mortgage payment gets “thrown away” on interest, taxes and insurance.\n\nNow that we’ve established this background, let’s return to the original argument:\n\nIf you rent, 0% of your monthly payments build equity.\n\nIf you own, X% of your monthly payments build equity.\n\nX &gt; 0\n\nOkay, that logic still seems solid, right? Even if you’re not building much equity, surely some equity is better than none … right?\n\nRiiiighhht?\n\nNot necessarily. Here’s the real question you should ask:\n\nWhat’s the next best alternative? Is building equity the highest-and-best use of your money? Or could you be doing something better with your limited resources?\n\nPhrased another way: What’s the opportunity cost of this equity-building?\n\n“Uhhh …. Opportunity cost? What do you mean?”\n\nOkay, before we launch into this, here’s one more fact that you need to know:\n\nHome Values Keep Pace with Inflation\n\nHome values historically keep pace with inflation. Nothing more.\n\nWhen people say, “my home increased in value,” they’re really saying, “yay, inflation rose!”\n\nDon’t take my word for it. Listen to Nobel-Prize winning Yale economist Robert Shiller, who gained public notoriety for predicting the Great Recession.\n\nAs early as 2005, Shiller started issuing warnings about an impending drop in real estate prices that could be as severe as 40 percent.\n\nDid he have a crystal ball? Is he magical? How did he anticipate this?\n\nHis strategy is ridiculously simple, yet effective. Shiller simply looked at U.S. housing prices dating back to 1890, stripping away inflation. He “benchmarked” the 1890 prices at a value of 100 and tracked relative housing costs through the lens of inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nThrough this, Shiller made a few observations:\n\nA house in 1897 cost the same as a house in 1997, adjusted for inflation.\n\nIf you benchmark 1890 prices at a value of 100, you’ll notice that U.S. housing prices have stayed within the 100-120 range over the past century.\n\nIn 1950, for example, the index stood at 105; in 1996 the index stood at 106. Real estate didn’t make any gains (other than inflation) during that 46-year timespan.\n\nStarting in 1997, an unprecedented bubble began forming.\n\nEvery housing ‘peak,’ or bubble, is followed by a tragic, painful, ugly fall.\n\nThe New York Times ran this scary chart in 2006 (before the recession), based on data from Shiller’s groundbreaking book Irrational Exuberance. (I’ve added red arrows for emphasis).\n\nImage credit: The New York Times\n\nAs you can see, housing prices (adjusted for inflation) typically stay within a narrow range — around 100-120 on that chart.\n\nThere have been only two notable exceptions. The first was triggered by the austerity of World War I, ending with post-WWII prosperity. The second was the rampant housing boom that started in 1997. And, well, we know how that story ends.\n\n“But housing is booming now!”\n\nSure, some people who bought at the bottom of the market in 2009 are now sipping champagne on the French Riviera. (I’m kidding. Kinda.)\n\nHome prices in many parts of the nation have doubled since the 2008-2009 lows. But in that same time period, the total U.S. stock market has nearly tripled.\n\nIn March 2009, the Dow Jones (a measure of the largest U.S. stocks) was valued at 6,626. Today its worth 3x more.\n\nKey takeaway: Housing keeps pace with inflation. And when it does produce real gains, it often underperforms the overall U.S. broad market.\n\nIf we cherry-pick dates, we can find a specific sliver of the population that’s enjoyed runaway home values since 2009. Housing underperformed the overall stock market during that same period.\n\nIf we cherry-pick locations, we can find specific towns or cities that enjoyed atypical growth, typically due to external influences like rapid job creation. This falls along a bell curve; we can also find towns and cities with unprecedented levels of decline. (Ahem, Detroit.)\n\nWhen we stop cherry-picking and “zoom out” into a multi-decade macro view, we’re left with the uncomfortable truth that U.S. housing prices don’t substantially increase in value. They merely keep pace with inflation, and they significantly underperform the overall U.S. stock market.\n\nShould I Rent or Buy?\n\n“So what? Why are you comparing housing to stocks? You have to live somewhere. You don’t have to buy stocks.”\n\nWe’re making this comparison because we’re asking the following question:\n\nAre you better off:\n\nTying up your cash into a home\n\nFinding an alternative investment, coupled with a rent payment?\n\nAny cash that’s tied up in home equity, including the down payment, is locked into a lifetime of just-keeping-pace-with-inflation.\n\nThis opportunity cost, combined with the additional overhead of homeownership, can (in many markets) negate any advantage that comes from owning.\n\n“Paula, that sounded like whoomp –whoomp –whoomp. Like Charlie Brown’s teacher. I understood about 0.0000001% of whatever you just said.”\n\nOkay, let’s …\n\n“Seriously, Paula, this is too technical. It’s making my head hurt.”\n\nAlright, let’s walk through an example together.\n\n“Fine. But you’re competing with Miley Cyrus’ latest tweets. And I gotta say, those are WAY more racy.”\n\nGotcha. Check this out:\n\nMeet Renter Rachel and Owner Owen\n\nLet’s meet Rachel and Owen, two people who are both hardcore savers. They haven’t met, because they’re figments of my imagination.\n\nObvious disclaimer: This example is for illustrative purposes only. Your personal expenses will be different. Duh.\n\nThis example is meant to illustrate that homeownership is not the slam-dunk golden ticket that society likes to believe.\n\nHere’s an illustrative example of one situation in which the buy vs. rent case isn’t so clear-cut.\n\nPlease DO NOT pitch a fit in the comments about “waaahhh, my interest rate is lower!” because this tells me you missed the point.\n\nThe point = crunch the numbers using the specifics of your personal situation, instead of making a six-figure decision based on an oversimplified cliche.\n\nIntuitively, we all know that if you’re going to live somewhere for one year, renting is better. And if you’re going to live somewhere for 40 years, buying is better.\n\nSomewhere between one year and 40 years is the crossover point, where buying becomes better than renting. It might be 5 years. It might be 10 years. It might be 15 years. It might be 20 years. It might be 25 years.\n\nThe question, then, is: Where is that crossover point? How can you solve this puzzle?\n\nThe solution comes from running scenarios based on a massive variety of factors, including the price-to-rent ratio in your area (we’ll dive into that concept later in this article), prevailing interest rates, tax brackets, utility costs, HOA fees, alternative investment opportunities and a long list of other factors.\n\nEvery human will have unique data points. That’s why every person should crunch the numbers based on their own personal situation.\n\nIf you don’t like the numbers in the example below, re-run the scenario using your own numbers. That’s the point. \n\nDon’t buy into oversimplified cliches like “renting is throwing your money away.” Don’t oversimplify a six-figure decision.\n\nOnto the example:\n\nRachel and Owen separately saved half of their income for the past few years. Now they each hold $102,500 in cash.\n\nRachel is a renter. Her rent costs $2,500 per month.\n\nOwen is an owner. His mortgage costs $2,500 per month.\n\nRachel paid her landlord a security deposit of $2,500. She invested $100,000 into a Total U.S. Stock Market Index Fund that earns an 8 percent long-term annualized average.\n\nOwen’s mortgage consists of $2,000 for principal and interest and $500 for taxes and insurance. He carries a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 5 percent interest rate, which means his loan balance is $372,500 and the value of the home is $465,000.\n\n“Can Rachel and Owen live in equivalent homes?” — Yes, if the price-to-rent ratio in their area is 15.5.\n\nWe’ll deep-dive into the concept of price-to-rent (P/R) ratio later in this article. Stay tuned.\n\nTo buy this house, Owen made an initial payment of $102,500, which divides out as $92,500 for the down payment (which is 20 percent of the home value) plus another $10,000 for the buyer’s side of closing costs.\n\nIn other words:\n\nBoth started with the same amount of money.\n\nRachel used her money to invest in a broad-market index fund.\n\nOwen used his money to make a 20% down payment on a home.\n\nRachel and Owen both live in their respective homes for 10 years.\n\nDuring that time:\n\nRachel’s rent rises 2% per year.\n\nOwen’s home value climbs 2% per year.\n\nInflation increases 2% per year.\n\nAre you with me so far? Sweet.\n\nLet’s talk about Owen’s mortgage:\n\nOwen has a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage.\n\nHis principal and interest payments stay the same, so he repays his loan with increasingly cheaper dollars over time (as inflation kicks in).\n\nHis property taxes and homeowner’s insurance premiums rise at the rate of inflation, which means his total mortgage payment climbs slightly.\n\nHe sets aside one percent of the home value, or $4,650 per year, to take care of maintenance, repairs and renovations. (He loses much of this value to depreciation of fixtures and mechanicals, which he replaces and upgrades in 10 years before listing the home for sale.)\n\nHe pays $300 per month in HOA dues.\n\n(Note: I ran this scenario through multiple online calculators. Each one gave me a slightly different answer. I’m posting screenshots from the NYTimes calculator. Please allow for slight variations, such as a $2,500 payment vs. a $2,557 payment, based on answers from divergent calculators. These minor differences don’t significantly affect the outcome.)\n\nStill with me? Let’s look at their utilities, maintenance and insurance:\n\nOwen and Rachel pay equal electricity, gas, cable and internet bills.\n\nRachel’s landlord covers water, sewer and trash, while Owen pays $85 per month for these combined services.\n\nRachel pays $307 per year in renter’s insurance.\n\nFinally, let’s chat about taxes and fees:\n\nOwen pays a six percent commission to the real estate agent when he sells his home.\n\nOwen itemizes his tax deductions and deducts his mortgage interest.\n\nBoth Rachel and Owen pay a 20 percent marginal tax rate.\n\nAny guesses on which person holds the upper hand?\n\nAnyone?\n\nSeriously, take a guess. C’mon now. Close your eyes …\n\nOkay, got it?\n\nWell, the results are in …. Rachel and Owen performed about the same.\n\nThey’re neck-and-neck.\n\n“But I thought renting is throwing your money away?”\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nBoth Rachel and Owen paid opportunity costs.\n\nRachel lost the opportunity to enjoy equity gains. This is exactly what people talk about when they make the argument that “buying is better than renting because you build equity.”\n\nShe missed the opportunity for equity gains from three sources:\n\n(1) Principal contributions\n\n(2) Renovations and upgrades\n\n(3) Market growth\n\nWe’ll talk about these later in this article.\n\nOwen, however, paid equal opportunity costs by missing out on the chance to invest $100,000 into an index fund. He tied up cash in a non-performing asset.\n\nI’m going to repeat this one more time for emphasis, because it’s so crucial:\n\nTying up your cash in a nonperforming or weak-performing asset carries a giant freakin’ opportunity cost.\n\nCan I repeat that again?\n\nActually, can you tattoo that on your forehead?\n\nTying up your cash in a nonperforming or weak-performing asset … sucks.\n\n[Quick tangent: Many real estate investors cite this to support “no-money-down,” high-leverage strategies. But this (1) costs higher interest rates, (2) costs mortgage insurance, and (3) creates a frightening risk profile. Anyway, this isn’t an article about real estate investing, and most primary-residence homeowners want to build equity, so I’ll stop this tangent.]\n\nBack to Owen and Rachel:\n\nTo be clear, both of them paid an opportunity cost. And in this specific example, with a specific set of assumptions, their overall net result was the same.\n\n“But I’m a Special Snowflake!”\n\n“My situation is different,” you might be thinking. “My HOA is lower. I’m in a higher tax bracket. I can qualify for 4.5 percent interest instead of 5 percent.”\n\nYeah. That’s the point.\n\nThe myth that “renting is throwing your money away” misses this nuance and detail.\n\nDon’t oversimplify the biggest purchase of your life by claiming that building equity is always superior.\n\nYou’re purchasing equity. And every purchase carries a tradeoff. When you buy equity, you necessarily don’t buy something else. Every dollar holds an opportunity cost.\n\n(Oh, don’t make me say it —)\n\nYou can afford anything, but not everything.\n\n(There! I said it!)\n\n“But I’m the Special-est Snowflake of All!”\n\n[UPDATE 11/30/2015: I’m getting flack from a lot of Special Snowflakes in the comments. Their arguments are along the lines of: “Waahh! I’m such a special snowflake! Your hypothetical illustration should have precisely reflected MY situation!”\n\nAre you having that same thought? Re-read this Special Snowflake section.\n\nThe headline of this article isn’t:\n\n“Housing might be a good deal if your interest rate is 4 percent instead of 5 percent!”\n\n“Housing might be a good deal if you live there until you die!”\n\n“Housing might be a good deal if the P/R ratio in your area is less than 15!”\n\nStop griping about the fact that your specific life doesn’t match the example. You personally may not have HOA fees, but that’s not true for everyone. Furthermore, it’s irrelevant.\n\nYour Special Snowflake circumstances don’t change the fact that everyone is responsible for analyzing their own variables. Don’t base the biggest purchase of your life on an intellectually lazy cliche.\n\nIn this article:\n\nI give you the exact tools and steps to run these numbers for yourself.\n\nI give you a framework for understanding the myriad of variables that play into this decision.\n\nI empower you to conduct your own analysis and make your own decision, based on your own circumstances, rooted in logic and math.\n\nMany people will grasp the lesson. And they’ll be richer for it.\n\nOthers, unfortunately, lack the ability to wade out of the details of a hypothetical illustration.\n\nThey’re more focused on nit-picking the deviations between themselves and one illustrative example — “waaahhh! my HOA is smaller!” — that they miss the bigger point.\n\nAnd in doing so, they shortchange themselves from an opportunity to learn.\n\nThe next time you get social pressure to “stop throwing money away on rent,” come back to this article. Crunch the numbers, using a calculator that lets you input a wide variety of variables.\n\nWealthy people think for themselves. Mediocre people cave to social pressure and lazy cliches.\n\nThree FAQ’s About Rachel and Owen\n\n“Why is Owen paying 5 percent interest? Aren’t today’s interest rates around 4.6 percent? That’s a 0.4 percent difference!!”\n\nLet’s learn history, shall we?\n\nFrom 1971 to 2015, mortgage interest rates (APY) ranged from a low of 4.6 percent to a high of 16.63 percent. During the majority of those years, average mortgage interest rates spanned between 6 to 10 percent.\n\nIf you object that Owen’s 5 percent interest rate seems outlandishly high, learn history. Owen’s interest rate reflects a near-record-breaking historical low.\n\n“Why do they both move out in 10 years? They should live their homes until they die!”\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, the average American stayed in their homes for only 6 to 9 years. If you object that the Rachel vs. Owen comparison should have assumed they’d live there until they die, look at behavioral data.\n\n“Rachel’s landlord needs to make money. How could he/she possibly earn a profit under this scenario?”\n\nHere are many ways Rachel’s landlord could benefit:\n\nThe landlord could purchase the property at a steep discount, such as through a foreclosure auction, short sale, estate sale, or by “driving for dollars” (making direct contact with the owners of distressed property.) This allows him/her to purchase the property significantly below market value.\n\nThe landlord could be holding the property for the sake of inflation-protected wealth preservation, rather than as a cash flow investment. (Don’t assume all landlords share the goal of cash flow. Some simply want to diversify their assets.)\n\nThe landlord could be making a speculative play on potential appreciation. (I don’t recommend this technique, but many landlords do this.)\n\nThe landlord could have inherited the property.\n\nThe landlord could have purchased the property decades ago, paid off the mortgage, and now enjoys the cash flow. They don’t want to sell/trade into a different property due to the hassle involved, so they let this property ride.\n\nOkay, tangent finished. Back to our regularly-scheduled article, already in progress …\n\nArgument #2: Rent is Forever. Mortgages End.\n\nDon’t worry. This next section won’t be as math-y.\n\nLet’s revisit the beginning of this article. There are three arguments that justify the “renting is throwing your money away” myth:\n\n#1: Rent is an expense. Mortgages build equity.\n\n#2: Rent is forever. Mortgages end.\n\n#3: Renters don’t benefit from rising home values. Homeowners do.\n\nWe’ve dismantled the first argument. Let’s deep-dive into the second: “You’ll pay rent forever. Your mortgage will eventually end.”\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\nIf you rent, you’ll always make rent payments.\n\nIf you own, you’ll pay off your mortgage within 15-30 years.\n\nFewer payments are better than more payments.\n\nTherefore, owning is better than renting.\n\nFlawed logic strikes again.\n\nThis reasoning presupposes that your mortgage is your only payment. That’s plain wrong.\n\nAfter you purchase 100% home equity, you own your home “free-and-clear.” This does not mean that you’ll never spend another dime on your home again. It merely means that you no longer need to make principal and interest payments, which are known as “P&amp;I.”\n\nHowever, P&amp;I are only one of many home-related expenses. Your other costs include:\n\nMaintenance\n\nRepairs\n\nRenovations / Depreciation\n\nProperty taxes\n\nHomeowner’s insurance\n\nUtility bills\n\nMunicipal usage fees (water, sewer, trash)\n\nHomeowner association dues (if applicable)\n\nTransaction fees, commissions and closing costs\n\nOpportunity costs\n\nHow much can this cost? Depending on where you live, those expenses could cost equal to or more than rent on a comparable property.\n\nHere’s an example for a $300,000 single-family home owned for 10 years:\n\nMaintenance: $50/month\n\nRepairs / Renovations: $250/month (1 percent of property value per year; includes major capital expenditures)\n\nProperty taxes: $300/month (1.3 percent of property value per year)\n\nHomeowner’s insurance: $125/month (0.5 percent of property value per year)\n\nUtility bills: $50/month (beyond what a landlord covers in a comparable rental)\n\nMunicipal usage fees: $75/month\n\nHOA dues: $250/month\n\nTransaction fees: $166/month (combined total of $20,000 out-of-pocket closing costs from both buying and selling with a 120-month holding period)\n\nOpportunity costs: $315/month (investment of a $60,000 down payment at a growth rate of 5 percent after inflation compounding annually; subtract the initial contribution and divide over 120 months, calculated via investor.gov)\n\nTotal cost: $1,581 per month.\n\nIn this example, owning a $300,000 home “free-and-clear” for 10 years costs $1,581 per month without a mortgage.\n\nKey takeaway: Your principal and interest payments are not the total picture. Not by a long shot.\n\n(Quick tangent: Unfortunately, many investors don’t do their homework. They jump blindly into the waters, assuming “if the rent covers the mortgage, I’m cool.” Then they lose their shirt.)\n\nHumans have many cognitive biases in our understanding of money. One of these biases is that we emphasize cash flow rather than the whole picture.\n\nWhen money leaves our bank account (e.g., paying bills), we feel the pain. It hurts! It hurts!\n\nWhen expenses are “invisible” (e.g., opportunity cost), we ignore it. You don’t miss what you never had.\n\nWhen expenses are lump-sum (e.g., replacing the roof, windows, siding, floors, garage door, etc.), we convince ourselves that our monthly costs are absent of those figures. “My costs are only $600 per month. Oh, and once every 20 years, I pay an extra $55,000.”\n\nIn the example above, you won’t literally watch $1,581 depart your bank account every month. At least $731 of that figure comes in the form of intangibles or lump-sums, which means you’ll only see around $850 per month leave your checking account.\n\nWhen that happens, it’s easy to fall into the cognitive trap of assuming that cash flow is the whole story. “My expenses are only $850 per month!” But it’s not.\n\nCash flow is a chapter in the novel. An important one. But as the Chief Human Responsible for Your Money, your job is to read and understand the whole book.\n\nZoom out and look at the big picture; make decisions accordingly.\n\nIn fact, if there’s one broad lesson from this entire article, it’s this: zoom out.\n\nIf you zoom out and look at the larger picture –inflation, investment gains, opportunity costs, legacy-building – you’ll start making smarter choices.\n\nBack to the debunking the “rent is forever; your mortgage is not” argument:\n\nYes, your P&amp;I payments will disappear after 15-30 years. But you’ll always pay for maintenance, taxes, insurance, renovations, care and operations of that house.\n\nYou’ll never be finished with home payments. Regardless of whether you rent or own, you’ll spend your life paying for housing in one form or another.\n\nDeath and taxes. And housing. And socks. These are life’s few certainties.\n\nYou’ll still need socks.\n\nThe question, then, isn’t: “How can I escape this perpetual payment?”\n\nThe question is: “Which of these two perpetual payments is more desirable? Would I rather pay rent in perpetuity? Or would I rather pay homeownership costs forever?”\n\nBefore you can answer that question, you’ll need to see which of those two numbers is bigger. And depending on where you live – Detroit or San Francisco? — the answer could go either way.\n\nThe myth that “renting is throwing money away” ignores the simple fact that the cost of rent, relative to the price of the property, occupies a HUGE range nationwide.\n\nIn some parts of the country, you can rent a $300,000 house for substantially less than $1,581 per month. Heck, the landlord will even throw in a free TV and send you a $25 Starbucks gift card.\n\nIn other parts of the country, you can’t dream of touching a property like this for less than $3,000+ per month in rent.\n\nAnd this leads us to today’s actionable lesson: Check the price-to-rent ratio.\n\nDon’t be a zombie who listens to oversimplified clichés. Spend 30 seconds doing a little bit of math.\n\n“Meth?”\n\nNo, math.\n\nThe formula for calculating price-to-rent is (predictably) the price divided by annual rent.\n\nPrice: $300,000\n\nRent: $1,500 per month = $18,000 per year\n\nPrice-to-Rent Ratio = $300,000/$18,000 = 16.6\n\nCool. So what does that number mean?\n\nHere are a few rules of thumb:\n\nIf the P/R ratio is greater than 20, hesitate before buying the house.\n\nIf the P/R ratio is greater than 25, don’t buy the house unless you have strong non-financial reasons.\n\nIf the P/R ratio is greater than 30, run screaming in the other direction.\n\nA house with a P/R ratio of 25 would equal a $300,000 house that rents for $1,000 per month. Or a $100,000 house that rents for $333 per month. Yeowch. That’s painful.\n\n(To put this into perspective, my bare-minimum-criteria for any rental property that I purchase is a P/R ratio of 8.33.)\n\nIn the Rachel vs. Owen example, their homes carry a P/R ratio of 15.5.\n\nFun facts about P/R ratios you can use to impress your friends:\n\nThe average is 11.95 nationwide.\n\nThe median is 11.27 nationwide.\n\nNationwide, P/R ratios range from a low of 2.84 (awesome for owners) to a jaw-dropping high of 46.38 (fantastic for renters).\n\nThe highest P/R ratios (best spots to be a renter) are in southern California and the northeastern states, particularly in major cities with concentrated business clusters such as San Francisco, Seattle, and New York.\n\nThe lowest P/R ratios (best spots to be an owner) are in the land-locked states. Many of the larger non-coastal cities, like Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Phoenix and Las Vegas, hold P/R ratios favorable to owners.\n\nWhen you’re calculating P/R ratio, follow these steps:\n\nUse the “total acquisition cost” – including purchase price, closing costs, and (if needed) upfront repairs to make the space minimally viable (e.g. if you bought a fixer-upper).\n\nRun three calculations: best-case, worst-case and mid-case.\n\nFor example:\n\nPurchase price: $440,000\n\nUpfront repairs: $10,000\n\nClosing: $5,000\n\nTotal Acquisition Cost: $455,000\n\nWorst-Case Rent: $1,800 /mo = $21,600/year\n\nMid-Case Rent: $2,000 /mo = $24,000/year\n\nBest-Case Rent: $2,200 /mo = $26,400/year\n\nWorst-Case P/R ratio: 21.06\n\nMid-Case P/R ratio: 18.95\n\nBest-Case P/R ratio: 17.23\n\nIn this example, we have a property that would obviously make a terrible real estate investment. A quick glance at the numbers makes that abundantly clear.\n\nBut it’s a viable candidate for a primary residence, given that the P/R ratio still points in favor of owning. It dances on the edge of the razor blade, but the balance tips in favor of ‘buy.’\n\nSo anyway –\n\nNow that I’ve given you some homework, let’s circle back to the justification that launched this conversation:\n\n“You’ll pay rent forever. Your mortgage will eventually end.”\n\nThat’s false. Nothing ends.\n\nYou’ll be making house payments until the day you die.\n\n(Sorry. But it’s true.)\n\n(Hey, I’m available for parties!)\n\nHere’s the smarter question that you should ask yourself: Will it be cheaper in the long-term to maintain a home or keep paying rent?\n\nThe answer is influenced by:\n\nWhere you live\n\nWhat “income bracket” of housing you prefer\n\nThe length of time you’ll hold onto the home\n\nThe ancillary costs of homeownership\n\nTo find your answer, check out the price-to-rent ratio, and weigh those four other factors I’ve listed above.\n\nArgument #3: “Renters don’t benefit from rising home values. Owners do.”\n\nAt this point, we’ve tackled two of the three misguided justifications for the cliché that “renting is throwing your money away.”\n\n#1: Rent is an expense. Mortgages build equity. – Debunked!\n\n#2: Rent is forever. Mortgages end. – Busted!\n\nLet’s tackle the final rationalization: “Renters don’t benefit from rising home values. Owners do.”\n\nHere’s the argument, broken down:\n\nHome values rise over time.\n\nRising values result in equity gains.\n\nHomeowners benefit from equity gains.\n\nRenters don’t.\n\nIn fact, renters are penalized, because equity gains correlate with rising rents.\n\nTherefore, owning is better than renting.\n\nLet’s dissect this argument. We’ll start with a deep-dive into the concept of equity.\n\n“Mommy, where does equity come from?”\n\nEquity is created in three ways:\n\n#1: Principal Reductions.\n\nImagine that you sell junk on Craigslist. You earn an extra $500. You use this to make an extra mortgage payment. Congratulations – you now have an extra $500 worth of home equity.\n\nThis is called “principal reduction.” You’re trading cash for equity.\n\nEvery dollar that you spend on principal reduction carries an opportunity cost.\n\nWe talked about this at length earlier, so let’s move on to two other types of equity gains.\n\n#2: Forced Appreciation.\n\nImagine that you get a $10,000 bonus at work. Hooray!\n\nYou use this money to upgrade your kitchen. You’re an excellent manager, and you oversee a hyper-profitable renovation.\n\nYour home is now worth $20,000 more, even though you only made a $10,000 investment. You’ve doubled your money.\n\nHalf this added value came from trading-cash-for-equity. But the other $10,000 came from forced appreciation, which is the result of knowledgeable, skilled management.\n\nForced appreciation comes from choosing the right property and managing it correctly. This is a real estate investor’s bread-and-butter.\n\nTalented investors don’t sit around, hoping that the market might rise in value. They take matters into their own hands. They spend $X to remodel a home, create a value that’s greater than $X, and pocket the spread — either through higher rental income or via sales.\n\nHere’s the question: Do you have what it takes to force appreciation?\n\n“Yeah, of course. I oversaw a bathroom remodel last year.”\n\nWell — that’s not exactly the same thing.\n\nSmart investors don’t spend money based on personal desires – “I’ve always loved this deep-blue granite!” They make informed, rational decisions based on profit and loss. (Remember this story?)\n\nInvestors don’t say things like:\n\n“I love these maple cabinets!”\n\n“This hardwood would look great with our furniture.”\n\n“Let’s wallpaper the living room’s accent wall!”\n\nHomeowners, by contrast, often make renovation decisions based on their personal tastes. This is a far less profitable strategy.\n\nForcing appreciation is a skill – just as playing guitar, dribbling a basketball and speaking Spanish are skills.\n\nKey takeaway: You can create equity through forced appreciation. But don’t assume you’ll hit a home run on your first swing. You’ll need skill and strategy first.\n\n#3: Market Gains.\n\nMarket-based equity gains come from growth in the overall housing market.\n\nLet’s say that you buy a house in January for $100,000. By December, that house is worth $102,000. Congratulations – you’ve gained $2,000 in equity.\n\nSounds amazing, right? Who doesn’t love something-for-nothing?\n\nBut here’s the tough truth about market gains: You’re outta control.\n\nThe housing market might rise, might fall, or might stagnate. It might do a combination of all three.\n\nIf home values climb, they may rise at a long-term annualized rate of 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent. Or maybe 10 percent. Who knows? There’s nothing you can do to affect these results.\n\nSure, you can purchase a home in a neighborhood that shows signs of appreciation: lots of new construction, permits and jobs are usually a good sign. Unless, of course, it’s 2007 and supply has drastically outpaced demand. Then you’re screwed.\n\nYou can’t control market gains. You have no influence over timing, scale, or direction.\n\n“Buy-and-pray” is not a wealth strategy.\n\nKey takeaway: Hope is not a plan. And it shouldn’t drive a six-figure decision.\n\nBack to the original argument: “Renters don’t benefit from rising home values. Owners do.”\n\nRising home values come from three sources:\n\nPrincipal reductions\n\nForced appreciation\n\nMarket gains\n\nWhat’s the cost of these?\n\nOne requires opportunity cost.\n\nOne requires skill.\n\nOne is outside of your control and historically keeps pace with inflation.\n\nI’d hardly call this a “benefit.”\n\n“But renters get nothing at all. At least owners are getting some equity.”\n\nLet’s return to that conversation about opportunity costs. Renters are:\n\nNot tying up cash in a downpayment\n\nNot tying up cash in renovations, repairs and maintenance\n\nPotentially paying lower monthly costs\n\nBy doing so, renters enjoy:\n\nGreater flexibility\n\nLower overhead\n\nFewer responsibilities\n\nOpportunity to pursue higher returns elsewhere\n\nSo … yeah. Plenty of benefits on both sides.\n\nIs Renting Better Than Buying?\n\nWhat conclusions can we reach at the end of all of this?\n\nShould you keep renting? Is renting better than buying? Or should you purchase a home? Is buying the better choice?\n\nYour answer is going to depend on a massive number of factors, including:\n\nThe local price-to-rent ratio.\n\nHow long you’ll live there.\n\nYour alternative investment options.\n\nYour assumptions about inflation and investment gains.\n\nMaintenance, repair, insurance, property tax and capital expense costs.\n\nThe rate at which rents rise.\n\nEt cetera, etc., etc.\n\nYou get the picture.\n\nMy goal is to impress upon you — once and for all — that this myth that “renting is throwing money away” is wrongheaded.\n\nIn fact, it’s dangerous.\n\nIt oversimplifies a life-changing, six-figure decision.\n\nIt’s probably caused thousands (or millions) of people to buy houses they later regret.\n\nAnd it needs to stop.\n\nThe next time you hear a friend or family member repeat one of these cliches — “I’m tired of throwing money away on rent” — send them this article.\n\nAnd the next time you catch yourself thinking the same thing (because we’re social creatures who internalize pop-mythology), come back and re-read this.\n\nThere’s no such thing as “throwing money away on rent” — not any more than you’re also throwing money away on cleaning gutters, paying property taxes, and for that matter, buying socks.\n\nIf you’re a homeowner (like me) and you enjoy it, good for you.\n\nAnd if you’re a renter, stop feeling guilty.\n\nNext time, we’ll focus on a different ridiculous statement:\n\n“I’ll skip dessert.”\n\nYeah, right. I’m going to prove that one wrong right now.\n\nTake Action\n\nTrack your net worth.\n\nEarn more! Start a blog in 5 minutes.\n\nTravel the world for free.

I’ve shared most, but not all, of these lessons on Instagram in the past year.\n\n1: Your net worth is not your self worth. That’s true regardless of whether your net worth is low or high. Money is what we accumulate, but it’s not who we are.\n\n2: It’s inefficient to worry about the small stuff (like how much you’re spending on avocado toast) if you’re not taking care of the big stuff (like how much you’re spending on your home, car and food, especially restaurants.)\n\nDon’t patch a few minor ceiling leaks if a huge section of your roof is missing.\n\n3: Don’t make decisions based on money alone. This applies to both earning and spending. For example:\n\nDon’t choose a college major or a career just because you think it will be high-paying. You’re more likely to fail (or languish in mediocrity) if you’re not passionate about your work. You’ll earn less over your lifetime, because you won’t advance. You’re more likely to make a midlife career change, which comes with its own costs, both direct (tuition, unemployment) and indirect (years wasted through suboptimal work).\n\nMaking the “financially rational” choice is expensive and irrational, because it’s unsustainable.\n\nLikewise, don’t accept a job or internship just because you think it will look good on a resume. Take it if you’re excited about it. One of the best decisions of my life was turning down a job offer that everyone around me exclaimed would “look good” and “be a great stepping stone.”\n\nHere’s a litmus test: If you were prohibited from listing this job on your resume, would you still accept it?\n\nThis principle stretches beyond career choices. For example:\n\nDon’t move to a city, town or country only because the cost-of-living is cheap (and for no other reason beyond that).\n\nDon’t stay in a relationship just because moving out and restarting your life is going to be expensive.\n\nDon’t buy a home that you dislike, just because it’s cheap.\n\nDon’t eat a diet of crap-on-crap, just because it’s cheaper than veggies.\n\nYou’re optimizing for living a sustainable, healthy, whole life, not for improving your net worth. Any savings or investment gains that come from neglecting the bigger picture, and making choices from a space of Spock-like rationality, are likely to erase themselves when your heart catches up with your mind.\n\nIf your heart’s not in it, it’s not going to work out. And that will ultimately cost more in the long-term, both financially and through the way it wears down your spirit.\n\nMoney that comes at the cost of YOU is too expensive.\n\n4: If you have to talk yourself into something, your heart’s not in it.\n\nHere’s an effective litmus test: when other people ask you “Why did you choose [X]?,” do you get triggered by the question? Do you rush to defend your choice? If so, then you might be trying to persuade yourself.\n\n5: Your blind spots are bigger than you realize.\n\nWhen you look back, they’ll be obvious. But no matter how hard you try to manage and optimize everything, you ARE overlooking something big. You’re doing it now. We all are. Stay humble, don’t make assumptions about other people’s motivations or future behaviors, and protect your downside.\n\n6: Your foresight is wiser than you realize.\n\nYou’re setting up your Future Self for amazing things, and you’re doing it in ways that you don’t even realize. Despite all of your planning and best efforts, Future You will look back on today and say, “I’m really glad I did that” about decisions that, at this moment, you find casual or inconsequential. No matter how hard we try to plan for the future, some of our best decisions are made by intuition or accident.\n\n7: Most people won’t understand. And you don’t need their approval, even if they’re your boss or your family. (Excuse me, I meant “especially if.”) If you’re living inside of your integrity, and other people don’t like it, that’s not your problem.\n\n8: You can delay gratification, but you can’t defer happiness. Or at least, you shouldn’t.\n\nIt’s tempting to think that you’ll be happy later — after you start earning more, after you quit your job, after you can live on your passive investment income. But happiness can’t be deferred.\n\nDon’t over-fixate on the future. Sure, goals are great, but if you’re too goal-oriented, you risk missing the present moment. You live for the next milestone.\n\nPlan for the future, don’t live in it.\n\n9: We don’t buy things. We buy stories.\n\nWe don’t (just) buy clothes. We buy the story and identity that the clothes represent. We buy the story that we’re professional, or modern, or hippie, or grunge.\n\nWe don’t (just) buy food. We buy the story and identity that the food represents. We buy the story that we’re clean and healthy, or a gourmand, or an animal-loving ethical eater, or a proud junk food addict.\n\nWe don’t (just) buy makeup. We buy the story and the feeling that we’re beautiful.\n\nWe don’t (just) buy transportation. We buy the story that we’re eco-friendly, or frugal, or rich and luxurious.\n\nEvery time we make a purchase, we’re buying a story, identity and feeling. The next time you’re thinking about buying something, ask yourself: “Do I really want this thing? Or do I want the story that it tells me about myself?” Then ask, “Can I get that story without buying this item?”\n\n10: Self-care IS business care.\n\nThe time that you spend going to the gym, practicing yoga, writing in your journal, or connecting with a close friend on the phone is not time that you are spending away from work or hustling.\n\nSelf-care is part of your work. It sustains your hustle. Even laptops need to recharge.\n\n11: Take care of the present, and the future will take care of itself.\n\nThis means:\n\nExercise. Eat clean. Sleep. Hydrate. Wear sunblock.\n\nSave for emergencies.\n\nMax out your retirement accounts.\n\nSlowly add to your investment portfolio (for example, buy one rental property every two years.)\n\nStart a side business.\n\nVolunteer and/or donate to worthy causes.\n\nSpend quality time with family and friends.\n\nGet aligned and right with today, and tomorrow will take care of itself.\n\n12: Don’t defer happiness. Discover happiness.\n\nSure, I could buy a BMW, but I wouldn’t enjoy it. It’s not me. I’m not “making a sacrifice” by driving an older, used car. I prefer used cars.\n\nDon’t defer happiness. Discover happiness within the healthy, optimal choice.\n\n13: Forget about results. The goal should be the action itself.\n\nInstead of: “My goal is to lose two pounds per month.”\n\nTry: “My goal is to fill up on vegetables, avoid processed sugars, and lift weights every-other-day.”\n\nIf your goal is based on results (lose X pounds), you’ll experience a demoralizing lag time between ‘actions’ and ‘results.’ But if your goal is based on the action itself, the actions ARE the results: “I roasted veggies, success!” or “I lifted today!”\n\nInstead of: “My goal is to start a side business that earns $3,000 per month.”\n\nTry: “My goal is to work on my side hustle from 7 pm to 10 pm every weekday.”\n\nIf you focus on actions, rather than results, then you’ll reduce your fear of failure and the procrastination that it creates. The fear of failure is terrifying, in part, because it’s a fear of something that’s outside of your control. You can’t control the outcome, you can only control your efforts. So let go of the outcome. Focus on the efforts. Let the consequences unfold as they may.\n\n14: It’s not about what you want. It’s about what you’re willing to sacrifice.\n\nI want six-pack abs. But I’m not willing to make the sacrifices that are necessary to create them.\n\nIt’s easy to list goals, aspirations and wants. But that’s not telling. The more prescient question is, what pain are you willing to endure? What sacrifices are you willing to make? What trade-offs will you embrace?\n\nMy friend Sheila (not her real name) is self-employed and holds $50,000 in credit card debt. She says she wants to pay it off. And sure, I believe that she wants that.\n\nBut she spends on frivolous items. She bought a monthly package at a salon, where she gets regular waxing and pedicures, because “it was a good deal!” She’s leasing a brand-new vehicle. ⠀\n\nAlthough she’s self-employed, she’s not trying to find more clients. She works 4-5 hours a day. She earns enough to pay her bills and make the minimum payments on her credit card, but no more.\n\nShe hasn’t made a dent in repaying her debt, other than the minimum payments, over the past year.\n\nI’m not surprised.\n\nI believe she wants to repay her debt. Who wouldn’t?  But she doesn’t want to accept the trade-offs. She’s not willing to work more than 4-5 hours per day, or sacrifice her spa retreats, or downgrade her vehicle.\n\nDuh, of course she’s not making progress.\n\nThe question isn’t “what do you want?”\n\nThe question is, “what trade-offs are you willing to make?”\n\n15: Stop telling young people to “enjoy it now while you still can!”\n\nMy friend Kim and I traveled to Europe together 10 years ago. At the time, I was afraid this would be our last trip.\n\nI was afraid that after our Europe excursion, we would return to the workforce and get stuck in 9-to-5 jobs that would limit us to two or three weeks of vacation per year.\n\nI was afraid we would trade our freedom for mortgages, cars, basements full of stuff.\n\nTen years ago, the “adults” told us to enjoy traveling now, while we still could. Their implication was that once we reached our late 20s or 30s, this window would be closed. We would succumb to mortgages and jobs and restrictions.\n\n“Enjoy it now while you still can!,” they said.\n\nFortunately, they were wrong.\n\nI built passive income through real estate investing. And Kim saves 50 percent of her income as a firefighter for the City of Austin, which gives her the flexibility to quit her job. She’s not financially free yet, but she has plenty of runway.\n\nThis is the power of managing your money, rather than letting it manage you.\n\nWe’re not unusual, either. Across the blogosphere, there are thousands of examples of people who travel full-time with children, dogs, or while managing illnesses and obstacles. Some people work the gig life, others are financially independent, others are laptop entrepreneurs. Some are all of the above.\n\nSome travelers are roadschooling their children, turning their life into the ultimate field trip. Some are creating new businesses from coworking spaces in Thailand and Colombia. Some travel for one year, others for a lifetime.\n\nThere’s a difference between “I can’t” vs. “It’s not a priority,” and the adults who advised us a decade ago that we “couldn’t” travel and explore when we were older must have missed this basic fact. Adventure may not have been a priority for them, which is fine, but they were remiss in advising young people that their lack of priority translates to someone elses’ inability.\n\nThe phrase “enjoy it now while you still can!” implies a bleak, boring future. (Ditto for the phrase “your college years are the best years of your life.” Really? Do the next 60 years of your life suck that much? That’s awful!)\n\nLet’s drop that idea. The future can be brighter than the past, and each of us has the power to make it so.\n\n16: You succeed at the level of your preparation.\n\nTo quote James Clear: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your habits.”\n\n17: Beware of pleasure at the expense of happiness.\n\nImagine that you have a giant bar of milk chocolate. You eat the entire thing in one sitting. That’s pleasure. But it won’t bring you enduring happiness.\n\nHappiness is long-term. Pleasure is short-term. Don’t trade dollars for pennies.\n\n18: Happiness comes from making progress.\n\nNot from drinking mai tais on the beach. Not from fancy cars. Not from buckets of ice cream. Happiness comes from spending a day making progress at something you find meaningful.\n\nI have a friend who teases me about working so much. She’ll text me at 9 pm on a Monday to say, “Hey, I’m in your neighborhood! Come get a drink!” and I’m like, “It’s 9 pm on a Monday!”\n\nShe’s also self-employed, and never fails to point out that I don’t actually have to work the next day. Which is true. Then she points out that I don’t need the money. Also true. Then she questions why I’m being such a square, and applauds herself for having escaped the rat race. Which is false; she’s in $75,000 of credit card debt and unprepared for retirement. But anyway.\n\nHere are two things she doesn’t understand: (1) I find more happiness in working and progressing than I do in sitting on a bar stool on a Monday night, and (2) I’m prioritizing anything productive, which could include reading a book, watching an educational video, changing out the reverse osmosis filter under my kitchen sink, making fresh pesto from scratch, building a Spotify playlist for my next workout, or organizing a huge stack of mail.\n\nProductivity and progress — in any arena of life, not just income-production — is a true source of meaning and happiness. Yes, socializing is important and soul-nourishing, but that doesn’t mean I need to say yes to every invitation or go out on Monday nights (or, for that matter, on Friday nights). Human connection is valuable, but if an activity is no longer meaningful, it loses its value.\n\n19: Waste is the opposite of value.\n\n20: Business and financial health is a reflection — a consequence — of overall health, especially brain health. Everything starts with a healthy brain and mind. This is the foundation for all success, both physical and financial.\n\n21: The concept of “delayed gratification” applies to both spending and earning. Most people only know this concept in the context of spending. They associate ‘delayed gratification’ with deferring a consumer purchase. But delayed gratification, when applied to the income side of the equation, is also the concept behind entrepreneurship, investing and building passive income.\n\n(That said, I’m not delaying jack. I find entrepreneurship and investing to be inherently gratifying.)\n\n22: Live at the boundary of your comfort zone.\n\nIf you’re too nestled inside of your comfort zone, you won’t push yourself to the edges of your limits; you’ll limit your progress. And if you’re too far outside of your comfort zone, your life will be a pit of anxiety and worry and stress until you take a hard pendulum-swing firmly back inside.\n\nLiving at the edge of your comfort zone might mean cutting expenses until you’re living just a little bit more frugally than you’re comfortable with.\n\nIt might mean waking up earlier than you would prefer to work on your side hustle.\n\nIt might mean overcoming the fear of meeting people at events, investing in training and education, raising your freelance prices, or asking for a raise.\n\nIt might mean quitting your job when the time is right, even though that makes you nervous.\n\nIt might mean traveling to a foreign country, including solo travel.\n\nIt might mean all of the above. Or it might mean something different entirely.\n\n23: Focus on value, not cost.\n\nA decade ago, I dismissed small indulgences, like flowers or candles, as a waste of money. I saw these as spending drains. These days, I look at value rather than cost. Does this make me smile? Does it brighten my day?\n\nI’ll calculate how many hours of my life might have gone into that purchase, and ask myself if it’s worthwhile. And many times, the answer is yes, it absolutely is.\n\nI’m willing to work an extra hour — or if we’re using a FIRE formula, I’ll work an extra year — if it means that I can still enjoy X, Y and Z. That’s absolutely worthwhile.\n\nThere’s a great quote from Oscar Wilde in which he says that “a cynic is a man who knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.”\n\nDon’t let frugality turn into cynicism. Value matters more than cost.\n\n24: One of my best friends wrote me a letter earlier this year and asked me these four questions:\n\na: What do you have (skills, capabilities, possessions) that might someday change or be gone? Take a moment to appreciate them, and accept that they will eventually end.\n\nb: What acts of kindness have you done that you are most proud of? Take a moment to experience the joy that comes from these memories.\n\nc: What experiences have you had that you cherish? These are yours no matter what, and can never be taken from you.\n\nd: Who are the most important people in your life? How recently have you told them?\n\nThe answers to these questions reveal more about your life than any spreadsheet, any tax-optimization strategy, any investment debate ever could. This is life. The rest is noise.\n\n25: Learning how to learn, thinking about how to think, and deciding how to decide, are the most important skills of all. (It’s also the secret mission of this blog and podcast — to teach people, including myself, how to improve the skill of thinking.)\n\n26: “Calling something ‘work’ does not make it a more noble use of time than anything else. Work that doesn’t advance you toward the life you want is still wasted time. You will never get those hours back, and we only get so many.”\n\nThis is a quote from Laura Vanderkam (a two-time podcast guest), and it summarizes a huge piece of my life philosophy.\n\nBut just as calling something “work” doesn’t necessarily make it more noble, calling something “leisure” doesn’t necessarily make it superior OR inferior to work. There’s meaningful leisure, and then there’s wasting time. Look within yourself to know the difference.\n\n27: Life teaches you the same lessons, over and over, until you learn them.\n\n28: We give the advice that we most need to hear. Everything that I’m saying, I’m telling you because I need the reminder myself.\n\nWhile you’re here, I’d like to share my 2018 Year in Review.\n\nAt the start of 2018, my goals included:\n\nDon’t travel as much (I’m feeling exhausted from years spent in airports and on highways). Enjoy home and build community locally.\n\nWorkout and build lean muscle mass.\n\nLaunch the rental property course.\n\nDevelop stronger relationships with friends.\n\nGrow the podcast.\n\nRaise at least $12,000 for charity: water.\n\nDeliver an awesome keynote speech at the World Domination Summit.\n\n(Yes, I know … goals are more effective when they’re focused on actions, not results. Yet the results pop into my brain nonetheless. Sorry not sorry.)\n\nHow did I do?\n\nGoal: Don’t travel as much.\n\nVerdict: Meh. Moderate success.\n\nLast year I traveled to 4 countries and 7 states, which is what I’d consider to be a lower-travel year. (Because I’m a nerd, I made a spreadsheet to track it.)\n\nMy greatest success within this goal was that I managed to stay home for 60 consecutive days — the entire months of February and March 2018. This marked the first time EVER I’ve stayed home for 60 consecutive days since moving to Las Vegas nearly four years ago.\n\nI’d consider this to be a moderate success.\n\nUpcoming 2019 is thick with travel plans. I won’t even have 30 consecutive days at home. This year is going to involve an immense amount of life on the road. I’m glad that I slowed down in 2018, however moderately, to give me the energy to rest and prepare for an on-the-go 2019.\n\nHere are my 2019 travel plans, as of now (and subject to change):\n\nJanuary – Los Angeles, Denver, Winter Park\n\nFebruary – Austin\n\nMarch – Austin\n\nApril – Austin\n\nMay – Seattle\n\nJune – Chile (and maybe Argentina)\n\nJuly – Colorado Springs\n\nAugust – either Burning Man or Europe or Japan\n\nSeptember – Washington DC\n\nOctober – Joshua Tree, San Diego\n\nNovember – Ecuador\n\nDecember – San Diego\n\n(By the way, here’s how I fly for free.)\n\nGoal: Workout and build lean muscle mass.\n\nVerdict: Hahahahahahahaha.\n\nGoal: Launch the rental property course.\n\nVerdict: In September, we launched to a second round of Beta Testers, in a group that we call “Beta Plus.” These students, around 190 in total, went through the course in (mostly) sequential order, offering feedback along the way.\n\nWe’ve created a Knowledge Base, a Known Issues Document and a list of Additional Improvements based on their feedback, and we’re continuing to update the course.\n\nWe also hired a designer and a developer to custom-build the platform, which we launched to the beta-testers in November. Check it out:\n\nWe’re eyeing a full (non-beta) launch sometime-in-early-2019, I hope. If you’d like to learn more, join the free VIP List. You’ll also get a free email series on rental property investing for beginners.\n\nGoal: Develop stronger relationships with friends.\n\nVerdict: Success! I nailed this one in 2018, devoting a lot more time and energy to connecting with friends who live across the country.\n\nGoal: Grow the podcast.\n\nVerdict: Success! We started the year with 2 million downloads and ended the year just shy of 5 million downloads (4.6 million). We’re averaging around 250,000 downloads every month, as a weekly show. (The Suze Orman episode aired in October, and we received 315,000 downloads that month.)\n\nMore importantly, the podcast community is engaged. They’re active in our Facebook group, they’re involved on Instagram, they leave reviews on Apple Podcasts (more than 1,166 reviews to date!), and they support our charitable drive. Which leads to the next point …\n\nGoal: Raise at least $12,000 for charity: water.\n\nVerdict: Success! I’ll let this image speak for itself:\n\nThank you thank you thank you thank you to everyone who donated to the campaign or bought a t-shirt. We’ve raised enough money to sponsor a water project (or two?!), and around 732 people will be able to drink clean, safe water.\n\nGoal: Deliver an awesome speech at the World Domination Summit.\n\nVerdict: You be the judge. 🙂\n\nIn 2012, I tried to buy a ticket to the World Domination Summit, but the tickets were sold out. I couldn’t get there as an attendee.\n\nFast-forward to 2018, and I’m delivering a main stage keynote. That’s how transformative six years can be.\n\nBecause of this history, I felt determined to deliver an amazing speech. But I knew I wouldn’t be able to focus on practicing my speech at home, amid endless distractions.\n\nIn order to rehearse this speech, I drove to Yosemite National Park, slept in the back of my car, and every night, I lit a campfire and rehearsed the speech to the flames. It gave me the quiet and solitude that I needed to focus on delivering an incredible performance on that stage.\n\nI slept in my car for eight nights to rehearse this speech.\n\nThis speech is one of the highlights of not just 2018, but of my seven-year history as a blogger. If you haven’t watched it yet, I encourage you to do so. I promise it’s worth 25 minutes of your life.\n\nIf you’d rather listen to audio, here’s the podcast episode in which I shared this speech.\n\nOther highlights from 2018 included:\n\n1: Winning the Podcast of the Year Award at the Plutus Awards, held at the financial blogger conference, FinCon.\n\n2: Winning the Lifetime Achievement Award at that same conference (although I still don’t understand — how do you win “lifetime achievement” at 34? Also, I’m not dead yet.)\n\n3: Watching the craziness of the Suze Orman interview going ultra-viral, and seeing the interview get written about on Time.com, Marketwatch and many other websites.\n\n4: Discovering that people view me as “calm” in my handling of Suze. (Cool! Although I wasn’t trying to be calm … I was coming from a space of genuine curiosity. I guess that has the same effect?)\n\n5: Getting featured in a two-page spread in Money Magazine.\n\n6: This.\n\n7: Hearing from hundreds of readers and listeners who paid off debt, bought a rental property, reached a six-figure or seven-figure net worth, or accomplished anything that was amazing and meaningful in their lives.\n\nThey wrote or tweeted or commented or left a voicemail to say thank you, even though the credit belongs to them.\n\nI can be a catalyst, but I cannot take action for you. Only you can do that. Many of you did, and you reached out and told me about it. Reading or hearing those voice messages brought me a lot of joy throughout the year.\n\nSo. Whew. That was 2018. It was an amazing year for Afford Anything, even though it was a tough year personally. This community has been my rock, support and source of meaning and joy. I’m excited to keep building on this in 2019, to spread the philosophy and ideas that this platform represents.\n\nCheers to you.

Or Your Life? - Afford Anything\n\n \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nAfford Anything\n\nApril 9, 2018Written By Paula Pant\n\nYour Money? Or Your Life?\n\nThere’s a scene in a classic 1950’s TV show, The Jack Benny Program, in which a mugger points a gun at the title character.\n\n“Your money or your life,” the mugger says.\n\nJack Benny is silent.\n\n“I said, your money or your life!” the mugger repeats.\n\n“I’m thinking it over!,” Jack replies.\n\nThe scene is funny because it’s absurd. When we face a choice between our money or our life, of course we’d rather live.\n\nBut day-to-day, most of us exchange our precious hours for a paycheck. We prioritize money over our life. And in that regard, the scene is also funny because it’s true.\n\nIn the early 1960’s, a scrawny New Yorker named Joe Dominguez decided to opt out of the rat race.\n\nJoe grew up in Harlem, raised in a bilingual household that received “welfare cheese.”\n\n“He was a runty guy, and wicked smart,” says his partner, Vicki Robin. “He couldn’t use brawn to survive, so he became the brains of his gang.”\n\nAlthough he never graduated from college, he maneuvered his way into a Wall Street firm, where he developed some of the finest technical analysis tools of the early 1960’s. Joe held the singular goal of retiring by age 30.\n\nHe retired at age 31 with a nest egg of about $100,000, according to his obituary in the New York Times. (That’s around $697,600 in today’s dollars.) He lived on $6,000 per year, equivalent to $40,700 in today’s dollars.\n\nIn the early 1970’s, Joe met Vicki, and a lifelong partnership began. Vicki had graduated with honors from Brown University and was working in New York when the two of them crossed paths. They discovered that their purposes and direction were well-matched, and they started teaching, writing and speaking about the concept of financial independence, or “FI.”\n\nIn 1992, they co-authored the book Your Money or Your Life, the culmination of their decades-long collaboration. The book sold more than one million copies and laid the groundwork for the modern FI movement.\n\nJoe died of cancer in 1997, at age 58. Two days before he passed away, he wrote cards for his family and friends that said: “Joe Dominguez has been given a clean bill of death. Please direct your attention to the living and to the things that need to be done.”\n\nVicki, now 72 and herself a recent cancer survivor, continues to do exactly that.\n\nYour Money or Your Life is not a book about managing money. It’s a book about transforming your relationship with money.\n\nVicki and Joe start by examining the concept of money:\n\nMaterial: Money is cash, credit cards, the stuff of daily transactions.\n\nPsychological: Money represents our fears and desires.\n\nCultural: Money represents our beliefs about our self-worth, about good and bad, winners and losers.\n\nLife energy: Money is the concept for which you trade your time.\n\n“Money is like a mirror that allows us to see ourselves,” the authors write.\n\nNext, they introduce the concept of enough.\n\nSociety teaches us that more = better, but the truth is that after a tipping point, more = clutter, distraction and noise.\n\n“Some people would say that once we’re above the survival level,” the book says, “the difference between prosperity and poverty lies simply in our degree of gratitude.”\n\nHow much is enough? Vicki and Joe describe four components of enough:\n\nAccountability: Understand how much money is flowing in and out of your life.\n\nYardstick: Find an internal yardstick of fulfillment that reflects your values, not social pressures and expectations.\n\nPurpose: Develop a purpose in life that involves contribution, rather than acquisition.\n\nResponsibility: Extend love and care into the world, and you’ll realize that having “enough” is closer than it may appear.\n\nThey outline 9 steps towards achieving financial independence:\n\nStep 1: Make peace with your past.\n\nFirst, find out how much money you’ve earned in your lifetime. (They describe in-depth strategies for unearthing this figure, but as a shortcut, you can check your lifetime earnings at ssa.gov).\n\nFind your net worth. (They describe in-depth strategies for calculating this, but as a shortcut, you can use this free net worth tracker.)\n\nFinally, view your lifetime earnings compared to your net worth. What do you have to show for the money you’ve made?\n\nIf you’ve invested well, your net worth might be higher than your lifetime earnings. If you’ve endured debt, your net worth might be lower than your lifetime earnings. No matter what your answer — no shame, no blame. Don’t judge yourself. Start with an honest understanding of where you are today.\n\nStep 2: Calculate your real hourly wage.\n\nFind out how much you earn per hour. (Here’s a shortcut: knock three zero’s off your annual salary, then divide by 2. If you earn $80,000 per year, you make $40 per hour.)\n\nThat’s your theoretical hourly wage.\n\nNext, subtract the costs of working, including commuting, buying office clothes, coffee and meals on-the-go, decompressing with happy hour specials or escapist entertainment, and paying for job-related illnesses.\n\nAdd the hours that you spend on all of the above — commuting in bumper-to-bumper traffic, ironing your pants, polishing your wingtip loafers, picking up the dry-cleaning.\n\nReadjust your numbers. You may work 40 hours a week, plus spend 15 hours per week commuting / dry-cleaning / meal-prepping / ironing. That’s a 55-hour work-related week.\n\nYou might earn $80,000 annually, but spend $5,000 per year on vehicle wear-and-tear, gasoline, office outfits, lunches and carpal tunnel treatment.\n\nNow calculate your real hourly wage:\n\nTime: 55 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 2,750 hours per year\n\nMoney:  $80,000 income – $5,000 job-related costs = $75,000 income\n\nReal Hourly Wage: $75,000 / 2,750 = $27.27 per hour\n\nNext time you’re tempted to drop $30 on a round of martinis, ask yourself if it’s worth an hour of your life.\n\n(I explore this exercise in my free e-book, Escape.)\n\nPsst. If you’ve already reduced your commute, or work from home, you can save even more. Check out Metromile – car insurance that starts at $29/month + a few cents for every mile that you drive. Get a free quote – it’s risk-free. Only available in CA, VA, WA, OR, IL, PA, NJ, and AZ. \n\nStep 3: Track your expenses, then convert into hours.\n\nYou can track your income and expenses in a few ways:\n\nIf You Prefer Cash: You could practice the “envelope system,” in which you spend cash from envelopes that you fill at the start of each month. Alternately, you could write your expenses in a notebook, or track it through an app like Evernote.\n\nIf You Prefer Credit or Debit Cards: Pay for everything with a credit or debit card, and link your account to an online program like Mint or Personal Capital that will sort it into categories.\n\nNext — and this is critical! — convert your expenses into the hours of your life energy that it consumed.\n\nIf you spent $350 at restaurants last month, and your real hourly wage is $27.27, those fancy dinners cost nearly 13 hours of your life.\n\nOuch.\n\nRemember — no shame, no blame. The goal is to face reality, not chastise ourselves.\n\nStep 4: Ask yourself three questions.\n\nNext, figure out if you’re spending money in a way that’s aligned with your values. To arrive at a deeper understanding of this, ask yourself three questions:\n\n1: Did I receive fulfillment, satisfaction and value in proportion to life energy spent?\n\n2: Is this expense of life energy aligned with my values and purpose?\n\n3: How might this change if I didn’t have to work for money?\n\nStep 5: Chart your money.\n\nCreate a visual chart of your total monthly income and expenses. Hang this in a prominent spot, where you’ll see it everyday. Pay attention to the gap between these two lines.\n\nStep 6: Spend less.\n\n“Frugality is enjoying the virtue of getting good value for every minute of your life energy and from everything you have use of,” the authors write. “Frugality means enjoying what we have … waste lies not in the number of possessions but in the failure to enjoy them. Your success at being frugal is measured not by your penny-pinching but by your degree of enjoyment of the material world.”\n\nIn other words, gratitude is the antidote to want.\n\nStep 7: Redefine work.\n\n“Our jobs now serve the function that traditionally belonged to religion,” the authors write. “They are the place where we seek answers to the perennial questions ‘Who am I?’ and ‘Why am I here?’ And ‘What’s it all for?'”\n\nRedefine work. Your work is survival and income, yes, and it’s also your contribution to humanity, and it’s also the enjoyment of your free time.\n\nWork is not always income-producing. Work includes the effort you invest into your health, your relationships and your community.\n\nValue your time and life energy. Don’t sell yourself short. Ask yourself probing questions, such as “how could I double my income without compromising my health or integrity?”\n\nStep 8: Find your crossover point.\n\nYour “crossover point” is the point at which the income from your capital is enough to cover your expenses.\n\nThe authors give the following formula:\n\n[capital x current long-term interest rate] divided by 12 = monthly investment income\n\nFor example:\n\n[$1,500 x 4%] / 12 = $5 monthly investment income\n\nYou can invert this to find out how much money you’ll need to cover your expenses. For example, if your expenses are $3,000 per month:\n\n[$3,000 x 12] / 4% = $900,000 total assets\n\nYou’ll reach the crossover point (financial independence) when your investment income covers your basic expenses.\n\n(Note: This merits a longer discussion about interest rates, and other types of investments. If you want to learn more about investing, read this or this.)\n\nStep 9: Invest\n\nYou can earn investment income in five ways, the authors write:\n\nInterest\n\nDividends\n\nCapital gains\n\nRents\n\nRoyalties\n\nVicki has multiple income streams: socially responsible index funds, bonds, rental properties, Social Security, local lending, and her “side hustle” as an author.\n\n“While writing a book is an elephant of a side hustle,” she says, “it also fits here because it’s episodic, snugs into my diverse life activities, and could disappear without crashing my financial independence.”\n\nLearn about long-term, income-producing investments, she says, and choose the ones that align with your values.\n\nMost financial advice is based on the idea that more-is-better. Your Money or Your Life is based on the idea that enough is enough.\n\nThis was a radical idea in 1992, when Vicki and Joe published the first edition of their groundbreaking book. This radical idea continues to thrive today — and fortunately, the idea is spreading further and faster.\n\nVicki joined me as a guest on the Afford Anything podcast to talk about the next evolution — moving from financial independence to financial interdependence. I recommend spending an hour of your life listening to this episode.\n\nBut first, answer one question:\n\nYour money? Or your life?\n\nJack Benny needed to think about the answer. We all need to think about the answer. Because implicit within this question is a hidden, second layer:\n\nHow much is enough?\n\nTake Action\n\nTrack your net worth.\n\nEarn more!

Brands, the giant parent company behind KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and the Habit Burger Grill. David shares stories from his remarkable career, offering insights into leadership, decision-making, and personal growth.\n\nWe dive into one of David’s most memorable projects: the creation of Crystal Pepsi. David talks about how the idea was born out of a gut instinct when he noticed a trend toward clear beverages. The media buzz was massive, and he was convinced it was a winner. But the Pepsi bottlers pushed back, saying it didn’t taste enough like traditional Pepsi. David pressed on anyway. The product launched to a lot of fanfare but ultimately flopped.\n\nDavid reflects on this experience as a lesson in the importance of listening to feedback, even when you’re sure you’re right.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to David’s unique upbringing. He lived in 23 different states before high school. This taught David to adapt quickly, make friends fast, and assess people and situations—a skill set that became invaluable in his leadership roles.\n\nDavid then takes you through his early career, from being a mediocre student who found his passion in advertising, to making a pivotal move from marketing to operations at PepsiCo. This shift was crucial, setting him up to eventually lead Yum! Brands.\n\nDavid’s journey is filled with stories of hard decisions, like turning down a bigger job at Frito-Lay because it didn’t align with what truly made him happy. He shares his philosophy on prioritizing joy and finding fulfillment in your work, a principle that guided his entire career.\n\nLeadership is a major theme in the discussion. David talks about the balance between confidence and humility, using Warren Buffett as an example of someone who embodies both. He also shares his thoughts on how to handle criticism and feedback.\n\nAccording to David, the key is to listen carefully, avoid being defensive, and understand whether the feedback is valid before making decisions.\n\nDavid also offers practical advice on personal development. He talks about his “Three by Five” exercise, where he regularly assesses who he is today and what he needs to work on to become more effective. This habit of self-reflection has helped him stay grounded and continually improve as a leader.\n\nThe episode wraps up with a discussion on company culture. David believes that creating an environment where everyone feels valued is essential for success. He emphasizes the importance of leaders modeling the behavior they want to see in their teams and being the first to extend trust and positivity.\n\nDavid’s stories and insights provide a deep dive into what it takes to lead a major company, make tough decisions, and continually grow both personally and professionally.\n\nTimestamps\n\nNote: Timestamps will vary on individual devices due to dynamic advertising run times.\n\n0:00 – Introduction to David Novak and his leadership background\n\n6:17 – David’s personal journey and learning framework\n\n11:25 – Importance of listening to feedback in decision-making\n\n17:31 – Impact of frequent childhood moves on David’s adaptability\n\n23:32 – Identifying and focusing on what brings joy in life and work\n\n29:26 – Value of learning that leads to action\n\n35:58 – Overcoming challenges by reframing your approach\n\n42:20 – Learning from mentors who have succeeded in your field\n\n48:35 – Criteria for board membership: contributing and learning.\n\n54:47 – Building a high-performance culture at Yum!

Yeah, me too. (See also: It's All Your Money)\n\nI say that even though it goes against my most fundamental principle of financial management — which is that you figure out what you most want and then arrange your life so that you get those things. To wish for money that somebody would make me spend on something else? That seems very wrong.\n\nI first became aware of this phenomenon when I was a kid, and my dad said something like this. He was talking about living-room furniture. But whether it's furniture or something else, I think everybody sometimes feels this way.\n\nSpending Goals, in Theory and Practice\n\nIn theory, I disagree. In theory, I say: If you want nice furniture, go ahead and budget for nice furniture. Make a plan, save your money, and then (when you're ready) go ahead and buy some nice furniture.\n\nIn practice, of course, when you allocate enough money to cover your needs, and then you line up your wants... Well, there are some that you get right away, some that take a little while, and some that take a long while.\n\nIt's for those last items — the ones that take a long while — that sometimes this feeling kicks in. It's not all of them. It tends not to be the really expensive ones. I've never heard anyone say, &quot;I wish someone would give me $50 million and tell me I had to spend it on a private jet.&quot; This feeling kicks in for the things that aren't so speculative. It's for the wants that are entirely affordable, if only they were just a bit higher in priority, but you can see will always — at least until you're rich — be behind a couple of other, higher-priority wants.\n\nThe Problem: Transient Wants\n\nAlthough it may seem contrary, I think this feeling — the desire for someone else to take control of your finances and tell you how to spend a big chunk of money — supports my theory. It happens because not all wants are fixed. Some wants are transient.\n\nI call my theory the &quot;one big lump&quot; theory of your money, in contrast to the &quot;bunch of little lumps&quot; of money pre-allocated to specific goals. I say all of your money should pre-allocated to satisfying all your goals. (See also: The &quot;One Big Lump&quot; Theory of Your Money)\n\nWhen you do that, you're in a position to optimally manage your money. You can use retirement accounts and college savings for their tax savings. You can choose your investments based on the time-horizons of the various wants in your plan.\n\nThat's harder when you start pre-allocating money for this or that want — and it becomes impossible when you start letting transient wants make a hash of your plan.\n\nIt's those transient wants that make you wish someone else would direct your spending. When you look at your shabby furniture and wish you had something a little more fancy — and then look at your budget and see that it's going to be years before you get to buy new living room furniture. That's when you wish for someone to make you re-prioritize that item. And that, I think, is a good enough reason to go back to basics. (See also: Plan for Your Wants)\n\nYou don't have to make a plan and stick to it. It is perfectly fine to adjust your plan as your desires change. If a transient want rears its head and says, &quot;Forget about the next six things you were planning to buy and buy me instead,&quot; it's perfectly fine to plug the new shiny thing in your plan right near the top.\n\nMaybe it won't stay there. Maybe a night's sleep and a bit of cogitation will make you realize that its old spot, six slots down down in your plan, was the right place.\n\nMaybe it will. Maybe the new shiny thing is what you should have had at the top all along.\n\nThese cases though — the cases where you find yourself wishing someone would take charge and make you buy something — are much more likely to be in the former category. Because the whole reason you feel that way is that you're in the thrall of a transient want. It won't last. Pretty soon your true values will come to the fore, and you'll end up back on your old plan (or one a lot like it).\n\nAnd if they don't — if it turns out that this new plan really is in closer alignment with your true values — that's okay too. Because it's your plan.\n\nIn my dad's case, he did eventually get new living room furniture, but not until after I'd gone off to college.\n\nHow do you prioritize your wants? Do you have a plan for them or do you satisfy them as they appear?\n\n \n\n              \n\n    \n Advertiser Disclosure ▾ \n\n    \n\n        \nThis page contains affiliate links from which we receive a compensation.

Say someone tells you to go buy a car that is way over your budget.  You get in over your head they you can always say Philip told me is was a good deal.  I agree that I probably has to do more with the wants in life since we cant justify buying something just as a want since it can always lead to being questioned if it was a good choice or not.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Liisa \n        #2\n\nI can definitely relate, and in truth it is why I love gift cards so much.  I HAVE to spend $25 at Barnes and Noble.  Sometimes I figure out a way to buy a needed gift for someone so I can pocket the &quot;real money&quot;, but it is often fun to be given permission to spend money on a frivolous category that I normally wouldn't.  I especially feel that way when the budget has been especially tight.  \n\nThat said, I would love new living room furniture but it will be several years before that happens.  Unless I somehow win a $5000 gift card to a furniture store...  I certainly wouldn't complain!  ;)\n\nREPLY\n\n Advertiser Disclosure: Many of the credit card offers that appear on the website are from credit card companies from which Wise Bread receives compensation.

I know it takes all those new car buyers to allow us used-car shoppers the luxury of so much inventory. I just want to stay in the ranks of the latter, not the former.\n\nMost people realize buying new often makes little financial sense, yet they justify it through a whole host of rationalizations. Even the federal government jumped on the bandwagon last year by suggesting we all needed to grind up our clunkers and buy new instead — for the sake of the national economy and the environment, no less. Was the result a whole fleet of new fuel-efficient cars on the road, or increased consumer debt and the loss of thousands of serviceable older vehicles? At the risk of sounding like I suffer from an acute case of sour-grapes, I’d like to explore just seven ways in which my old clunker may be a smarter choice than even the newest hybrid. (See also: How to Cut Car Ownership Costs)\n\n1. Fuel Efficiency Isn’t Always Green\n\nBy some estimates, more than 25% of a car’s carbon dioxide emissions come from the manufacturing process (this can include design, testing, building, marketing and shipping). Since my used car has already gone through the manufacture and transport phase, it produces no new demand for automobiles and therefore, no additional environmental demand. Even though it only gets 22 miles per gallon on a good day, driving it responsibly arguably produces less pollution than purchasing new. If going green is truly driving (pun intended) your purchase, this consideration should give you pause.\n\n2. Steep Depreciation\n\nThough the jury is out on the long-term depreciation rates of hybrids, most new cars lose as much as 20% the minute you wave goodbye to the dealer. Where else can you lose $0.20 on every dollar with just a signature and a click of a belt buckle? If you aren’t paying for the car outright, add finance charges to the mix and remember, all this delightful financial devastation is occurring to after-tax dollars — dollars that won’t be around to invest. That’s four major hits for every buck spent: one hit from the tax man (payroll tax and sales tax), one hit from depreciation, one hit from the finance company, and one last blow from the loss of earning power of each dollar tied up in your new purchase.\n\n3. Premium Rates\n\nEven if you’re paying for comprehensive insurance on a used car now, premiums go up for later-model automobiles. Hybrids are no exception; more complex engine systems and batteries mean higher repair costs and higher insurance rates. Of course, full coverage is mandatory if you have a car loan — the bank wants to protect its investment. But used cars that are paid-off can be covered by liability insurance only (based upon comprehensive insurance costs vs. auto replacement cost calculations). Being able to control your insurance costs can make driving used even more fiscally prudent.\n\n4. Higher Registration Costs\n\nThe fees and formulas vary from state to state, but typically, licensing and registration costs are directly related to the value of your car. Much like insurance, higher car values equal higher rates.\n\n5. Higher Repair Costs and Repair Standards\n\nIf you’ve ever bought a new car only to get a scratch or windshield chip a few weeks later, you know that newer cars compel us toward a higher standard of perfection. People are more likely to keep a new car as pristine as possible for as long as possible, and those little touch-ups and repairs tend to cost more too. My old Volvo has a door ding, some weird stain on the hood, and the plastic trim is bleaching out. Besides a compulsive cleaning and wax-job every few months to make it shine, I live with these road wounds happily.\n\n6. The Phenomenon of “Incestuous Affirmation”\n\nThis is really just a fancy term for keeping up with the Joneses. It suggests that any major new purchase sets in motion a whole slew of buying activity within a close network of people (friends, coworkers, family, etc.) by affirming the behavior of one member. This ripple effect is felt from the least capable of affording new to the most capable and creates a slight uptick in unspoken standards within the group.\n\n7. New Peripheral Expenses\n\nFrom add-ons to upgrades, new cars increase standards and raise monetary output. Of course your baby needs premium gas, a hand-buffing each week, and a GPS system. And what about that monthly fee for satellite radio now that first year of free service has expired?\n\nNow, many of these same principles can be applied to any purchase where there’s a reasonable choice between new and used. But our nation has such a love affair with the automobile and such a cultural acceptance of the resulting debt that it begs a bit of special exploration. What are the new economic realities that make buying new less attractive? Are we really in the same position our parents were when they traded up every few years? How do car companies entice us with nickels before the purchase only to damn us with dollars afterward?\n\nGranted, none of the points above explore the amazing safety advancements that some new cars feature. I would never put a price personal safety or begrudge a car purchase with this as the primary motivator. But with such a wide range of later model used cars available, it doesn’t have to be an either/or proposition. All else being equal, each blemish and bump on my used car is masked by the dollar signs I see behind them — the dollars I save by keeping it in good working order and running smart for as long as possible.\n\nThis is a guest post by Kentin Waits.

I think you're as well off buying a cheap, fuel-efficient vehicle than spending a bunch of money on a hybrid car. While I find that my car is cheaper to fuel, the biggest savings in fuel efficiency come from the WAY that I drive. A couple of times during the past week, I had to accelarate more rapidly than normal in order to avoid being run off the road when merging onto the freeway, and the difference in my fuel efficieny (two accelerations! two!) was really drastic.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Guest \n        #3\n\nagreed.\n\nmy 20 yr old civic cost $3000, gets 37 mpg, and does great at smog check every time.\n\n(but plain old driving less is certainly the most effective way to save on gas.)\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Guest \n        #4\n\nAnd it will also allow you to get hurt much worse if you are in an accident as it does not have abs or airbags....but as long as you save a few dollars!\n\n                        bArlington \n        #5\n\nObvious observation - you're contrasting new versus used.  If the contrast is new versus new - than high efficiency (aka hybrid) wins, right?  Second, I dont think this is &quot;opportunity cost&quot; - maybe its &quot;risk&quot; - not sure: when I buy a new car - it's new, I am buying it from a dealer, and its under warranty.  We've had two Hondas.  They have been really reliable and what probs they had have been resolved.  Used cars - I dont know how to buy them. Each car is like playing roulette - you dont know how it was treated and abused.  You dont know what condition it is in except for a superficial guess.  Most used car shops are - well they dont have great reputations lets just say.  So okay, I could buy a used car but (a) I would need to invest a lot to become smarter about cars or (b) I accept much higher risk that the car will be junk and opportunity costs for living at the repair shop.    As for factor 4 - you are guessing.  In Virginia that is not true.  Factor 5 - again, reliability.  If you look at Consumer Reports tracking reliability over time, your statement isnt true - when cars are young, they are much more reliable than when they are old.  Say it a different way, you will have more repairs when the car is older.  Factor 6 - who cares about the Jonesses.  Factor 7 - probably the people reading this blog - that's invalid.  If I want to pimp my ride, I am going to do that for a used or a new car.  So this is invalid.  So if I take your valid points - depreciation, fees, insurance, and my points about reliability and buying a car I know is going to work - I think you end up with a different strategy: BUY AND HOLD.  I think people on average own cars for 3 or 4 years??  We own cars for 10.  We drive our cars into the ground.  A big factor is reliability (read Honda).  Buy a good car, take car of it, and own it for a long time ---- oh yeah, and Andrea is right ---- how you drive make a huge difference!\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Kentin \n        #6\n\nYes, definitely contrasting new vs. used -- but that is the crux of the article.  New supports new demand, rather than pulling from existing auto inventory.  Your other factor counterpoints all make for a compelling discussion around a topic that gets too little.  Thanks.\n\n                        J. \n        #7\n\nEducating yourself to be able to buy a good used car is a bit of effort with very high return. You can do quite a bit to minimize the risk: run a CarMax title search on it by VIN, bring up the Kelly Blue Book value (online), search Craigslist to see what similar cars are selling for, request that the owners provide you with the service records, have a mechanic do a check-up.\n\nOn the flip side, if you're selling, having a neat binder with your maintenance records in chronological order will do a lot to engender trust and make sure you get the full Blue Book value. So plan ahead!\n\n                        Guest \n        #8\n\nYou provide valid arguments for a &quot;buy and hold&quot; attitude. If you have environmental as well as financial reasons for this approach, you might want to consider yourself a  &quot;manufacturer of quality second hand vehicles&quot;- cars that have been well maintained, that don't have hidden wear and tear that will cause grief to the (probably) low income people you eventually sell to, cars that deserve to exist due to their long life, low fuel consumption etc. Your final sentences suggest you are doing just that.\n\n                        Brian \n        #9\n\nNicely done.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        simple in france \n        #10\n\nWe believe in holding onto a car until it dies and can't be brought back.  I'm glad to see that this is at least somewhat environmentally wise.  Also, I'm frankly not that impressed with the gas mileage of hybrids compared to some of the most fuel-efficient normal cars and the fact that the battery is likely to die after an unknown number of short years is also a red flag.  We had to buy another car this year here in France (lost our old one to an accident).  We found a used one with decent gas mileage.  Perhaps we'll be able to hold onto it until someone creates a hybrid worth our money. . .better yet, until we can buy one used.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Tom \n        #11\n\nYour clunker is smarter for YOU than buying a NEW hybrid car.  That is your argument.

This is because they haven’t done the math. Take the difference between the cost of the current vehicle and the new vehicle. Then take the difference of what you are/would be paying in gas for the vehicles. Many people would have to keep their new vehicle over 12 years before it would pay for “just” the difference in gas. Then think about upkeep costs on the new vehicle, and go price the batteries. This game is all about $.\n\n \n\nREPLY\n\n                        Guest \n        #16\n\nI just heard Clark Howard on the radio and his rule of thumb is if buying new then run the wheels off the vehicle makes sense. If buying used then purchase a 2 to 3 year old vehicle and run it for four years. This I'm sure is looking at the cost of ownership only; $cost per mile to own a vehicle. But if your looking at the financial aspect only it sounds like good advice.\n\n                        dave \n        #17\n\nMostly sound reasoning why hanging on to an older car makes sense.  But the higher fuel consumption is an issue worth looking into more closely.  For an individual, there is not likely payback for purchasing a car that gets better fuel economy - do the math and the cost savings from an extra 10 mpg doesn't justify a new car purchase. (at 67% of annual fuel spending - I would save about $900/year. Not worth it to me, personally.)  But the savings to society of using less fuel - if every driver were to cut fuel consumption by 30%, the reduced demand would mean less drilling and lower cost of other petroleum-dependent products.\n\n \n\nI don't believe that hybrids are the answer though.\n\n \n\nSo true, holding on to your current clunker makes sense for you.  But if we put them all together, we can make a needed change.  But then, we should be trying to break out of car-culture altogether.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Justmike \n        #18\n\nIt would mean less &quot;consumer&quot; spending on fuel when smart type cars become more available, &quot;but&quot; you would pay that much more for everything else. Why? Because 18 wheelers, Busses, and Jets depend on fuel also, it does not really matter if it's the same type, as long as the payment is there. If you do not believe that, just look at the different fuel costs over the last 20 years alongside each other. In time things will change, but from a bottom line view, for &quot;most&quot; people, that time is not now. $\n\n \n\n \n\n                        Rosa \n        #19\n\nIt's possible to have a car and take steps outside the car culture at the same time - you just have to not plan based on the car.\n\nWe chose to live where we can bike/bus commute, we chose our son's childcare partially because it's near home, and we make the extra effort to choose the bike over the car when we're not sure.\n\nSo what we have is a car that gets about 25 mpg, but we only use it for about 1/3 of our in-town transportation - that's like driving all the time and getting 75 mpg, only it's a lot cheaper (we have a $9,000 used Toyota and about $2500 worth of bikes/gear/child hauling trailer - only the bike stuff has no insurance/tag costs and minimal repair costs.)\n\n                        Squirrelers \n        #20\n\nI think the real value of holding a &quot;clunker&quot; is the mindset that one holds while doing so. I don't mean low aspirations; on the contrary, many people who are frugal do aspire to finer things. The thing is, you want to strategically pick your spots, and focus on what's more important. For many of us, its saving for retirement, unforeseen future medical conditions, child's college expenses, etc. Driving a clunker often means just shifting resources that could be given toward a car, to more important long-term needs.\n\nI'm not knocking the value of hybrids in an environmentally conscious way - rather, I am pro-hybrid. I would just rather drive an older, conventional car that has been well maintained and has already been paid for, instead of buying a newer car. I drove a car to over 200,000 miles before selling it a few years ago. The good thing was that I sold it while it was still in good working order and before repairs were needed. I sold it within a few hours of having it &quot;on the market&quot;, and had no guilt that people might have when selling a lemon, because it was a good car. It was a great scenario - I drove a car that was fully paid, extracted more value than I thought I could out of it, and sold it before further investment was needed.\n\nNow, if you could have an old, &quot;clunker&quot; hybrid, that might be the winning ticket!\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Kentin \n        #21\n\nAn important point.  The Achilles Heel of any consumer is being drawn in to all available spending opportunities without being mindful to larger goals.  Frugal folks get a bad rap for being cheap when, in reality, we are just focusing our goals in a different (sometimes not obvious) direction.  \n\n                        Kelsey \n        #22\n\nGood points. I have a 7 year old car, and while that's definitely not very old, it still makes more sense to pay it off and keep it for at least 3 more years before even thinking about getting a different car. And I say 'different' instead of 'new', because my next car will be used, as it is more economical.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Dave \n        #23\n\nIt isn't economical to be green. Operating a hybrid results in lower polution, but you're carrying around a few hundred pounds of hazardous waste in your batteries. Today's cars (in fact, cars newer than 1977) are much cleaner running than older ones. Recent advances in emission controls have been chasing diminishing returns and jacking up the price by requiring expensive &quot;smog control&quot; features. Fuel efficiency and emissions are linked, but even if your driving habits are poor and your mileage is low, your emissions are still really low, just not as low as possible. Relatively speaking, hybrid or not, all cars from the last three decades are very clean burning cars. It's not the car, but the driver that determines fuel economy. Buying a hybrid just doesn't make enough sense.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Luke \n        #24\n\nWhat ever happened to quoting sources?  I'm in agreement with the article, but where does this 25% CO2 info come from?  \n\nREPLY\n\n                        Kentin \n        #25\n\nHi...sure, the source for the 25% figure came from the following study:\n\nSource: Adapted from Chapter Three of Changing Drivers: The Impact of Climate Change on  Competitiveness and Value Creation in the Automotive Industry\nAuthor:  Duncan Austin and Amanda Sauer\nDate: 2003\n\n \n\n                        Guest \n        #26\n\nCite for the 25% figure please!\n\n[ Note, I'm not doubting that number, it seems quite reasonable.

Hubby commutes a long way to work (all highway), so with that kind of driving a regular internal combustion engine DOES get decent enough mileage that it -would- take 10 years to pay off the difference in gas savings at the current or a slightly higher price-per-gallon of gasoline.  We also researched the service bulletins on each model year and learned some hybrid model years are plagued with weird little problems, while other model years seem to be problem free, so you DO need to be extra careful with the new technology.  After 6 months of -much- shopping around, we finally found the exact gently used hybrid model we wanted at a price that will &quot;pay itself&quot; in gas savings at the current price per gallon in approximately 5 years, including the cost of anticipated battery replacement every 100,000 miles.\n\nWhat finally made the decision towards a hybrid is environmental concerns and deep concern we've passed Hubbard's Peak and our government is still in denial about it.  When the inevitable energy crisis comes, it's going to be every bit as UGLY and MESSY as the bank bailouts and I don't care to be housebound while politicians point fingers and say &quot;nobody knew this was coming.&quot;  Being old enough to remember the gas lines of the 1970's, I say NO THANKS to repeating that whole sordid soap opera!!!  \n\nIf gas prices suddenly spike back up to $3.50 per gallon (which I am betting they will within the 7 years we are planning on keeping this gently used car) the economics of buying a hybrid or other alternative technology change drastically.  What made the decision to pay more for a hybrid is an educated gamble ... if the price spike comes, the only choice will be the old inefficient clunker whose gas-tank we can't afford to fill -or- a brand new hybrid, not a reliable secondhand car.  Spending the $1000 more (which we had to do much shopping around to bring down that cost spread) is a form of insurance to us (though perhaps not to someone else ... this IS a free country after all!)\n\nWe're keeping our fingers crossed that the unknown of the hybrid battery won't make us regret the decision.  In the meantime, the old 300K &quot;baby&quot; still works well enough for local driving.  Our eldest will be using it every summer and school vacation break.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Guest \n        #34\n\nAn economy is money flow. At any point that we may have gas lines like in the 70's, it will affect each and every person in some way. I think that in time the transportation technologies AND prices will become cheaper and better. All TECH takes time.\n\n                        SirThoreth \n        #35\n\nIn 2004, I bought a brand new Pontiac Sunfire, which got 26/36 listed MPG (later downgraded to &quot;30 MPG average&quot; by the EPA, which was about right), for around $12000.  Financing increased that by nearly 50%.\n\nA year after I finally paid off the vehicle,145,000 miles, and nearly $4000 in repairs later (two new clutches, a brake overhaul, and a rebuilt transmission), I was hit by another driver this past February, and my car was written off as a &quot;total&quot; (the frame, along with the entire front end, was pushed over by about an inch).\n\nMy new daily driver is a 1966 Volkswagen Beetle I picked up on the cheap (actually, I traded a '71 Ford LTD Convertible for it, but the previous owner wanted around $2500 for it), and I couldn't be happier.  I don't drive the same amount I used to, thus the 15K miles/year the Bug will be handling won't be a problem.  Routine maintenance on the Bug might be more frequent (oil changes and valve adjustments every 1500 miles) than the Sunfire, but cost significantly less, and larger repair jobs are much more straightforward to complete, and cheaper to boot.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Joe Average \n        #36\n\nWe buy cars and keep them forever. For us it is a cheap way to have a car. A few details: I do ALL of my own work so repairs cost me parts only. I have a good selection of tools so I seldom need to buy tools anymore. Secondly, we've worked very hard to learn to just be satisfied with what we already have. We've watched people around us race from one fad to the next one. People around us discarded perfectly good CRT TVs for flatscreens. We'll watch our's until it is &quot;dead&quot;. Don't care if we only have a 24&quot; TV. We've watched friends discard gadgets and computers that had alot of life left in them because the next &quot;cool&quot; thing came along. We've watched people around us who got bored with their cars and traded up when they couldn't really afford it. $400+ dollars goes a long way in our budget so we avoid payments. \n\nWe drive a '99 CR-V with 197K miles. It has been very, very good and even sports the original clutch. Our other car is a '97 VW Cabrio. It has needed much more attention but generally little stuff that I can do myself. While the Honda looks good still the Cabrio has some rough edges. It will be a challenge to keep both looking good in their old ages. We're discussing replacing the Cabrio with something newer in the next year or two so the Cabrio can be sold with some miles and thus some value in it. I still like it though. Will buy a wagon type vehicle such as a Volvo, Jetta TDI wagon, or BMW. Would buy domestic but the domestics don't offer wagons. They offer sedans, trucks and SUVs. I hear Buick is going to sell the Opel Insiginia wagon here as a Buick Regal (YAY!) but it will be far outside of our budget of about $15K for a lightly used vehicle. \n\nWe also have a 200K mile aircooled '78 VW camper and a 125K mile '65 Beetle. Both work well for fall back vehicles - i.e. vehicles to drive when our commuter vehicles are down for a repair. Would not want to drive them daily. The Westfalia van gets maybe 18-20 mpg. The Beetle gets maybe 25 mpg. Both lack proper rustproofing and thus would age quickly in daily use again. They are not as safe as a modern vehicle but I don't buy into the idea that I need to drive a tank with racing harnesses and 39 airbags to be safe. I have to be alert just like when I ride a motorcycle. \n\nWhat I'd like to add is that you need to make quality repairs with quality parts with a quality mechanic (or yourself where you make it right). Aftermarket parts have qualities that ranges from mediocre to very good. I used to sell aftermarket car parts at a FLAPS. Some of those rebuilt parts virtually promised that the vehicle owner would have to make the same repairs annually. An example would be a radiator for my CR-V. The original radiator lasted about 140K miles and sprung a leak. I tried to have the old radiator repaired. $25. No dice. Purchased an aftermarket radiator for $125. It lasted 13 months. Sprang a leak. Spent a few dollars trying to seal it up. Also failed. Both radiators leaked between the end tank and the core along a crimped plastic/aluminum seam. Bought another replacement radiator and if this radiator fails then I could have purchased an OEM radiator across the counter at the dealer. They know me there now for little things I buy from time to time and often offer me little discounts and conveniences like preordering parts without prepaying. Yes the sales staff are typical - looking for an easy sale but the parts guys are down to earth and helpful. I also have foudn the OEM guys sell me front brake pads for less than the aftermarket &quot;better&quot; pads. These pads are quiet, don't cover the wheels with brake dust, and last ~85,000 mles. The recent $25 aftermarket set I bought promises to wear out at half that 85K figure, blackens the wheels in 3 days, and are noisy all the time. False economy. I have had the same experience with tires. Cheap tires deliver me vibrations and noise and short lifespans. In the long run the better tires have been more satisfying to own and drive. Hope someone finds my rambles useful.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Cheap Yankee \n        #37\n\nThanks for the OEM parts tip for the CR-V (and the good news that yours is still going strong at 197K).

However, I disagree with your first point on being green relative to the manufacturing process. The manufacturing cost is a sunk cost--whether I buy or not, the manufacturers will still build &quot;x&quot; number of cars per year. Keeping my car does not change the fact. If all cars were built to order, then this argument would have relevance.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Phillip \n        #40\n\nDon't you think that creating demand or supporting demands helps promote more sunk costs tho?  I think the writer might be looking at demand as something supported by a more comprehensive market.  Less demand = less market = fewer sunk costs.\n\n                        Life McGowan \n        #41\n\nThe comparison between an old and new relies merely to the beneficial aspect of the thing. Of course the new offers a lot of technological efficiency rather than the old, this is the wise thinking. But for the majority of those considerate believers, it's the value of the car that they embrace.\n\nWell I personally agree with the idea that innovation takes a lot further in terms of productivity as well as cost efficiency. Doing a further calculations would state the basis of getting a more quality vehicle with just the same or a little lesser expense.\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Kate \n        #42\n\nAs a person who has driven &quot;sturdy&quot; old clunkers most of her adult life, I found a validating peer in Kentin and his loyalty to same.  As for finding reliable cars, I've always depended on the expertise of my mechanics (two different, over the course of time), who also view and purchase vehicles at auctions, to obtain reliable used vehicles when needed (three total used cars in 23 years of driving them). &quot;CarFax&quot; reports and its ilk also provide useful information as regards avoiding individual vehicles with hidden predispositions to serious fault.\n\nHaving said all that, I now, however, find I need to agree with Barlington re: the &quot;buy and hold&quot; strategy being ideal.  I purchased my first new car at age 40, and at age 44 intend to drive my Toyota (yes, that's right...) Matrix with 60K miles for another 60K, at least (certainly, for as long as it runs).  As most of my miles are on the highway, commuting between Boston and senior-aged parents in Buffalo, a Hybrid just didn't seem to offer much to me, mileage-wise, to justify it's much greater sales/maintenance costs. I average about 35mpg over the road (and utilize public transport in Boston), and that's fine with me...\n\nOne little thing I did at purchase which has reduced costs -- I bought a new car from the previous model year.  Off the bat, my purchase price and excise tax were steeply discounted; my insurance is lower each year than would have been, and my &quot;new one year old&quot; purchase seems to be holding a decent price as it ages out...\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Brenna \n        #43\n\nFunny, right before I read this I was just thinking how grateful I am for my '97 Honda Odyssey and no car payment.  She's got just over 100K on her, and I'm anticipating about another 4-5 years before she's just not serviceable anymore with major expense.  Still, even if I was paying $100 a month in maintenance that's still cheaper than any car payment out there.  She get about 22 mpg in normal driving, and if I'm on the highway a lot it's close to 30.  Works for me.  :)\n\nREPLY\n\n                        Guest \n        #44\n\nI buy new car's and drive them until they die.

Big things like buying a house, paying for college, and retiring comfortably don’t happen by accident. Neither do little things, like filling your gas tank without worrying it will drain your checking account.\n\nLarge or small, every household has financial needs and goals.\n\n“But a goal without a plan is just a wish,” said Tiana Patillo, a Financial Advisor Manager at Vanguard.\n\nMaking those wishes come true takes study, strategy, and determination. It takes a plan. Having one doesn’t guarantee you won’t face financial failures, but it will certainly make that less likely.\n\nWhat Is a Financial Plan?\n\nA financial plan is an overarching document that establishes your monetary goals and how you will achieve them. It encompasses income, expenses, savings, debt, investments, and all other aspects of your financial picture.\n\nWhat Is the Financial Planning Process?\n\nThere is not a singular way to come up with a financial plan. You can do it yourself, though we’re talking about your financial security here. Unless you are knowledgeable in accounting and investing, you should consider hiring a licensed financial planner.\n\nEither way, the financial planning process usually begins with getting a clear picture of your financial circumstances. Before you go to work, you need to know what you have to work with. Then you should:\n\nEstablish your goals, both short-term and long-term.\n\nDevelop strategies to reach those goals.\n\nImplement those strategies.\n\nKeep track of your progress and alter your strategy as needed.\n\nTypes of Financial Plans\n\nA good plan will encompass all your financial situations. If you have children, you’ll want a plan that addresses college, trade school, or other education expenses.\n\nWhether you want to get out of debt, set yourself up for retirement, prepare for emergencies, or avoid taxes, there should be a strategy to accomplish that goal.\n\nRetirement Planning\n\nMaking sure your golden years aren’t financially tarnished is a big part of most financial plans. To prepare for retirement, you need to save money and invest it during your high-earning years. Do it wisely, and you’ll generate a reliable cash flow until you no longer have any bills.\n\nEducation Planning\n\nThe average cost of an undergraduate degree ranges from $25,707 to $218,00, according to the Education Data Initiative. Whether your kids go to Yale or Yakima State, it takes a while for most people to come up with that kind of money.\n\nSaving for college could include 529 plans, Roth IRAs, student loans, or other programs. Whichever you choose, the faster you start, the better off you and your wallet will be.\n\nDebt Management Planning\n\nIt’s hard to save money when you owe a lot of it. The average balance on credit cards alone was $6,329 in 2024, according to TransUnion.\n\nA debt management plan is designed to consolidate your debts with a lower interest rate and pay them off in 3-5 years. Once you’re out of the hole, you can get serious about building wealth for the future.\n\nTax Planning\n\nAny viable financial plan tries to keep Uncle Sam’s hands off as much money as possible. There are plenty of ways to do it legally, so the IRS won’t hassle you.\n\nHow To Create a Financial Plan\n\nCreating a financial plan is a methodical process. Whether you do it yourself or get help from a financial planner, these steps should get you where you need to go.\n\n1. Set Financial Goals\n\nThis can be the fun part, at least at first. You decide what you want your future to look like, both in the near and far future.\n\nDo you want to take a cruise? Pay off your credit cards? Own a house? Pay for your kid’s college tuition? Drive a Rolls-Royce? Retire to a villa in Monaco?\n\nThe not-so-fun part is realizing how expensive some of those goals are. So be aspirational since it will motivate you to do the things necessary to reach your goals.\n\nBut also, be realistic. Monaco would be fancy-schmancy, but a condo on Panama City Beach wouldn’t be a bad place to retire. Set your financial goals accordingly.\n\n2. Track Your Spending\n\nIt will be hard to reach your financial goals without a clear picture of your finances. Create a budget, which will answer two basic questions.\n\nHow much money do you make? How much money do you spend?\n\nAnd where does that money go?\n\nRent, car payments, utility bills, groceries, Netflix subscriptions, Happy Meals – tracking it all can be a chore. If you need help, there are plenty of money apps that make it easy.\n\nWhichever way you do it, seeing where your cash flows will help you develop strategies to reach your financial goals.\n\n3. Build an Emergency Fund\n\nThe best-laid plans can be destroyed in a blink. A tree could fall on your house. An accident could put you in the hospital. A company could downsize and lay you off.\n\nIf you’re not ready for such shocks, you’ll have to retool your entire financial plan. The best way to get ready is to build an emergency fund.\n\nYou can start small. Try to put away $1,000 so you don’t have to put a brake job or root canal on your credit card. Eventually, you’ll want to put away enough to get you through most emergencies and lean times.\n\n“You should have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses saved in readily accessible investments to help safeguard you when the unexpected occurs,” Patillo said.\n\n4. Reduce Your Debt\n\nDebt means you’ve borrowed money, and borrowed money comes with a price. Interest rates are like a gaping wound on a budget, a 25% gaping wound (or higher) for credit cards or some loans.\n\nThat can add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month. Worrying over how you’ll dig out of the financial hole can also lead to sleepless nights. All of which makes it vital to pay down high-interest debt.\n\nMillions of consumers have attacked the problem with a debt management plan. Credit cards are combined into one monthly payment at a lower interest rate.\n\nSuch programs typically take 3-5 years to complete. It can be time well spent since it will reduce your financial stress. And once you’re out of the hole, you can really start building for the future.\n\n5. Plan for Retirement\n\nRetirement is like Christmas. It always seems far off, and then suddenly it arrives. The problem for many Americans is there won’t be enough money under the retirement tree.\n\nThe typical Gen X household has $40,000 in private retirement plans, according to a study by the National Institute on Retirement. Almost 40% of Gen Xers haven’t saved a penny for retirement.\n\nThat age group, born between 1964 and 1980, came along as the U.S. shifted from traditional pension plans to 401(k) or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) as the primary retirement strategy.\n\nIf you have an employer-sponsored retirement plan in which your company matches part of your contribution, that’s free money. Try to match whatever percentage your employer contributes.\n\n“The most common mistake I see people make is not contributing enough to their retirement accounts,” Patillo said. “Because you can’t borrow for retirement, saving for it is a priority.”\n\nThe do-it-yourself plans have worked out fine for millions of Americans. Millions of others need to get busy, or they might be working until they are put in the ground.\n\n6. Build a Tax Strategy\n\nNo doubt, filing a 1040 Form is an annual headache. A good financial planner can reduce a lot of that pain.\n\nThere are many ways to shelter income through exemptions, deductions, credits, deferred payments, and other programs. A tax expert can find all those legal loopholes that save you a lot of money.\n\n7. Invest to Build Wealth\n\nEverybody dreams of hitting it big in the stock market, and why not? If you’d bought $10,000 worth of Amazon stock in 1997, it would now be worth about $17.8 million.\n\nThe problem is, there aren’t a lot of Amazons out there. That’s not to say stocks and bonds shouldn’t be part of a financial plan. History shows they are a sound investment when managed correctly.\n\nIt can be as simple as investing in your 401(k) plan. Or you can delve more deeply into the stock market.\n\nA lot will depend on your age and how quickly you want to accumulate wealth. If time is on your side, low-risk investments like blue-chip stocks and bonds are probably the way to go. If you need to be more aggressive, a qualified advisor might steer you toward technology or renewable energy stocks.\n\n8. Estate Planning\n\nIf your financial plan works as hoped, you’ll face a big question. What do you want to happen to your wealth when you’re gone, or no longer able to make sound decisions?\n\nDo you donate it to a charitable cause? Set up a trust for the ongoing care of your racehorses and pet chihuahua? Distribute it evenly to your kids, even if one is a struggling missionary and another is a real estate kingpin?\n\nYou need a will that states your final wishes. Other estate-planning documents can spell out how you want to be cared for and who has power of attorney if you can no longer manage your affairs.\n\n9. Monitor and Refine Your Plan\n\nA financial plan should not be chiseled into stone. Be it marriage, kids, health issues, job status — whatever! – the only constant in life is change.\n\nYou will eventually need to tweak, alter, and maybe completely overhaul your financial plan to reflect the changes that come along. Once the changes are made, you need to closely monitor your plan to make sure you’re still on track to meet your financial goals.\n\nBenefits of Financial Planning\n\nFrom motivation to peace of mind, the payoffs are more than monetary with a financial plan. Among them are:\n\nReduces worries over your future.\n\nProvides a clear and detailed account of your financial situation.\n\nAlerts you to unnecessary spending.\n\nBoosts your motivation.\n\nSaves you money on taxes and interest charges.\n\nProvides short- and long-term goals.\n\nIncreases the chances you’ll meet those goals.\n\nStart Your Financial Plan Today\n\nIt might be too late to start a plan that will ensure you’ll retire wealthy or pay for an Ivy League education for all your kids, but it’s never too early to start lining up such goals.\n\nComing up with a plan takes a planner. If you don’t feel up to the job, find somebody who is.\n\nThere are resources available that help you create a budget and stick to it. You may need credit counseling or a debt management program to get out of your money hole and start building a financial future.\n\nJust remember, the future comes fast. As Benjamin Franklin said, if you fail to plan for it, you might as well plan to fail.\n\nTom Jackson\n\nTom Jackson focuses on writing about debt solutions for consumers struggling to make ends meet. His background includes time as a columnist for newspapers in Washington D.C., Tampa and Sacramento, Calif., where he reported and commented on everything from city and state budgets to the marketing of local businesses and how the business of professional sports impacts a city.

As in, $17.8 trillion big. That was the total amount of household debt in the United States in the second quarter of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nHousehold debt isn’t the only thing standing between we collective Americans and financial independence, but $17.8 trillion should give you an indication of how far we are from it. How will we ever get out from under a number that oppressive?\n\nIt’s a good question, and it leads to more pertinent questions about a smaller-picture number, the number your household is contributing to that big-picture debt total. What’s your share of that $17.8 trillion deficit? How much do you owe? And how far are you, as one American, from financial independence?\n\nHere’s a frame of reference: The average total debt balance in this country in 2023 was $104,215. Yes, we called it a “smaller-picture number,” and there’s a good chance it doesn’t feel at all little to you. Again, there are factors other than your personal consumer debt to consider, but even that $104,215 average might have you convinced that autonomy over your money is out of reach.\n\nIt isn’t. You can let your financial freedom ring regardless of how much you’re currently being oppressed by your bottom line.\n\nThere are important, and sometimes difficult steps to take, including reducing that debt amount. But with careful planning and discipline, you can break away from the yoke of money stress and begin to celebrate your personal fiscal independence day.\n\nWhat Is Financial Independence?\n\nFinancial freedom means different things to different people. It might mean the life you want to live without the daily grind of a steady job. It might mean a retirement fund that guarantees your golden years will be as fulfilling as possible. It might mean the confidence that you’ll be able to handle whatever unexpected financial crises crop up. It might mean an escape from the spiral of debt that keeps you from making ends meet.\n\nBut there is a common denominator. In all those cases, financial freedom means an existence without the worries your money (or lack thereof) has been causing you. It means you can wake up every morning untroubled by today’s bills and unconcerned about tomorrow’s expenses. In that sense, financial independence is a state of mind as well as hale and hearty savings.\n\n9 Steps to Financial Independence\n\nFor starters, your path to financial freedom probably will require some painful personal sacrifices. Unless you’re already living frugally, you’ll likely have to cut back on your non-essential spending and find a way to bump up your earnings. That means forgoing some of your guilty pleasures and redirecting some of your precious leisure time and energy to increasing your income.\n\nBut most of the steps to financial independence are less unpleasant than that. They call on you to be disciplined, organized, and educated about your finances, which anyone can do.\n\nLet’s look at how to get out from under all those money problems.\n\n1. Define Your Financial Goals\n\nWe told you earlier that financial independence means different things to different people. Your first step, then, is to decide what it means to you. Is it life without work? A robust retirement? The ability to travel? College education for the kids? Make a list of your financial goals, some timely little ones as well as the big-picture long-term objectives. When you know what your endgame is, you can plot the strategy to get there.\n\n2. Track Your Spending\n\nSpend the next month recording every penny that leaves your possession. Do it daily. Record every outlay, from the monthly rent to the morning donuts. Groceries. Gas. Movies. Beer. Insurance. Phone. If keeping a ledger by hand is too onerous, use a spending tracker app you can find online. After 30 days, you’ll know exactly where your money went. That’s your starting point for deciding how and where to cut back.\n\n3. Create a Budget\n\nYou’re already halfway there because you’ve been tracking your spending. That’s the hard part of creating a budget. The other half is easier — detailing how much money you have coming in, including your take-home pay, social security, pensions, child support, dividend earnings, alimony, and any other wherewithal you take in over the course of the month. When you create a budget, you can see how poorly (or how well!) you’re doing at managing your money. A budget is the best way to spot inefficiencies in your spending habits and show how you can adjust going forward. As with tracking your spending, there are apps for budgeting.\n\n4. Reduce Your Debt\n\nYou can’t just snap your fingers and magically make your debts vanish, but you can be sensible about how you attack the balances on your credit cards and loans. One way is the debt snowball method, in which you rank the amounts you owe from lowest to highest and work toward eliminating the smallest balance first by paying as much as you can on it every month (while continuing to pay the minimum on the other balances) When that one is paid off, move on to the next one. Another is the debt avalanche method, in which you rank your debts by the size of their interest rates and start by paying as much as you can on the one that carries the highest rate, working down your list that way. Or consider debt consolidation, which reduces the number of payments you make every month and lowers the interest you pay at the same time. However you do it, you’ll eventually see the bottom-line benefits.\n\n5. Set Up Automatic Savings\n\nIt’s the best way to make sure you save money regularly. By automatically transferring some of your regular paycheck into a savings account, you won’t have to remember to do it manually. And because you won’t have immediate access to the amount you’ve automatically directed to savings, you’ll be less tempted to spend it at a restaurant, a movie, a boutique, or in some other non-essential way. Most savings accounts allow you to earn interest on money you put into them. You can maximize the interest rate on those deposits by directly transferring a portion of your earnings into a high-yield savings account or a brokerage account.\n\n6. Start Investing\n\nInvesting is one of the best ways to make your money work for you. Yes, it can be risky, but patience and a diversified investment portfolio minimizes the danger and maximizes your steady progress toward your financial goals. Remember when we said the keys to becoming financially independent include becoming educated and organized about your money? An online brokerage account will help you with both. As you make regular contributions to it, your brokerage account will teach you how to be a smart investor and how to structure your portfolio to ratchet up your returns. For example, a brokerage account will help you diversify, which protects you from the high risk of a single stock investment that can come with a bigger payoff but also cause greater damage to your bottom line.\n\n7. Live Below Your Means\n\nThis is a no-brainer step. It’s also one of the hardest steps if you’re accustomed to buying what you want when you want it. The goal is to make sure you’re making more money than you’re spending. When you do that, you’ll have a surplus every month that you can save in a way that moves you closer to your financial goals. That, after all, is why you created a budget back at Step No. 3. It’s your road map to living below your means.\n\n8. Monitor Your Credit Score\n\nDon’t take anything for granted, including the benefits of a good credit score. The three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) that compile information from lenders, creditors, and public records to create your credit score aren’t infallible. A 2024 study by USA Today said that 44% of the people who read their credit report, find errors. If the reporting agencies get something wrong or if you’ve been a victim of identity theft, your score can drop through no fault of your own. That can slow down your steady march to financial independence when you’re applying for a new credit card, mortgage, auto loan, or insurance and discover you can’t afford the borrowing rate. It’s easy to monitor your credit score. Your credit card companies, or other lenders, often include your credit score on their statements or make it available through your online account. Plus, each of the three bureaus must give you a free credit report every year. All you need to do is ask!\n\n9. Increase Your Income\n\nThis is another big challenge. Chances are, you already think you work hard enough and don’t have the bandwidth for a part-time job or a side hustle. But finding ways to augment the income side of your monthly budget will move you toward financial independence in several meaningful ways. You’ll have more money to pay off debt. You’ll find it easier to live below your means. You’ll be able to make bigger contributions to your online brokerage account. So, ask for that raise. Look into side jobs. Start your own craft or service business out of your home in the evenings. Hold a garage or yard sale. It can be done. Commit to it!\n\nBegin Your Journey to Financial Independence\n\nThere’s your road map: nine steps to financial freedom. Simple, right?\n\nBut it isn’t simple, of course. This route isn’t an as-the-crow-flies straight line. You’ll no doubt run into detours along the way. You’ll likely encounter unexpected expenses that throw your budget off kilter. Maybe some of your investments go belly-up. Could be your financial goals change as time goes by and you’ll have to adjust your strategy to meet them. Any number of things can slow your progress.\n\nDon’t despair. When roadblocks get in the way, don’t be afraid to reach out for help. If you’re struggling financially, seek out credit counseling from a nonprofit credit counseling agency. During a session with a counselor, you’ll be provided with a personalized budget review, an analysis of your debt, and recommendations for an action plan. You’ll also be presented with debt relief alternatives to get you back on track.\n\nFinancial freedom might seem a long way off, but remember the two key essentials to making it happen: having a plan, and exercising discipline. If you keep them in mind, you won’t lose sight of your destination.\n\nAnd when you reach it, feel free to throw yourself a parade. It’s your Independence Day, after all.\n\nMichael Knisley\n\nMichael Knisley writes about managing your personal finances for InCharge Debt Solutions.

Every time you turn on the TV there are ads for everything from financial firms that will guide your money to the perfect investment, to phone apps that make investing easy with a couple quick swipes.\n\nYou don’t want to miss out, but you have debt – credit cards, student loans, maybe a mortgage. You may wonder, which is the better financial move – investing or paying off debt?\n\nThe two financial moves are apples and oranges.\n\n“For most people, debt is a separate function from investment,” Lucia Dunn, a professor of economics at Ohio State University, said. “Investments carry risks that need to be considered.”\n\nInvesting money, particularly in the stock market, doesn’t guarantee you will make money, or even how much you will make. Dunn said that most economists would advise a person in the median income range not to deviate from their normal repayment patterns for debt obligations in order to invest.\n\nThat said,  investing while paying off debt, or paying off debt, then investing, may still be a good move.\n\nShould You Pay Off Credit Cards or Invest?\n\nIf you’re considering investing, “It always makes sense to pay off the debt with the highest interest charges first,” Dunn said.\n\nThat means credit cards. Credit card interest rates  in  2021 average about 16.65%. The lower your credit score, the higher your interest rates. If you don’t pay the cards off every month, you might be closer to 30%.\n\nDespite the fluctuation, credit card interest rates are a lot easier to predict that the stock market. While there are crazy highs and lows on stocks and mutual funds, the average rate of return on stock investing over the past several decades is 8-to-10% a year. The average credit card interest rate, on the other hand, has steadily risen and in recent years has been between 16 and 18%.\n\nSo, it’s better to pay off high-interest credit cards, or at least lower the interest rates, before spending money on investing.\n\nOne way to get rates down is to get your credit score up, which means making payments on time and lowering your “utilization rate” (how much credit you’re allowed vs. how much you use).\n\nIf that seems hard to do on your own, you may want to consider a debt management program or debt consolidation.\n\nDebt Management Plan\n\nA debt management plan with a nonprofit credit counseling agency consolidates credit card debt and lowers the amount of interest you’re paying on it. You make one affordable monthly payment to the agency,  to eliminate credit card debt. The agency distributes the money to your lenders at an agreed-upon rate that pays off the debt in 3-5 years.  Your credit score improves as payments are made on time and the amount you owe shrinks. Debt management plans come with a monthly administrative fee of $30-$50.\n\nDebt Consolidation to Improve Credit\n\nDebt consolidation involves getting a loan that has lower interest and using it to pay off your credit cards. The loan can be secured, meaning you use an asset, like your house, as collateral to get a lower interest rate. Or it can be an unsecured personal loan, which has no collateral, but a higher interest rate. If your debt consolidation loan has a lower interest rate than the average return on investment, you may want to start investing the money that would normally be going to pay that high interest.\n\nShould You Pay Off Student Loans or Invest?\n\nMost people who take out student loans borrow through the federal program, which has fixed interest rates between 2.75% and 5.3%. Private student loans have more of a range, as high as 12.99% for fixed and 11.98% for variable, which means the rate can change for better or worse.\n\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has put a pause on collecting student loan payments until at least October 2021, and interest won’t accrue during that period. Borrowers can still pay if they want to, with the entire payment being applied to reducing the principal during the 0% interest period.\n\nThere is no such pause on private loans – it’s up to the lender, and payments can change suddenly for those with variable interest.\n\nMany experts urge borrowers to pay back their loans, and to take advantage of the no interest period if they can to get the principal down. While there’s no guaranteed return on investments, there is one on paying back loans, particularly paying more than the principal.\n\nShould You Pay Off Your House or Invest\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate, with points, was 3.08% for those with excellent credit scores in 2021. Mortgage rates tend to be much lower than the rate on return for investments. On top of it, paying a mortgage is one of the surest investments you can make.\n\nThe longer you pay, the more equity you have in your home. Assuming you make payments on time, a mortgage is a tremendous boost to your credit score and history.\n\n“(Mortgages) not only usually carry a low interest rate, but gradually becomes an asset over time and can be used as collateral to finance other things down the road, like children’s education,” Dunn said. “So, paying off a mortgage at the usual rate makes sense unless a person suddenly gets a windfall – like winning the lottery.”\n\nShould You Use Investments to Pay Off Debt?\n\nInvestments are a way to build financial security in the long term and most economic experts stress that the idea is to let them build, ignoring fluctuations and looking at the end goal.\n\nWhen investing, it’s important to assess the risk, something that all investments have, to make sure you’re not going to lose money. “Even conservative, insured investments, such as certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by a bank or credit union, come with inflation risk,” the Financial Industry Regulatory Association (FINRA) warns. “They may not earn enough over time to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.” FINRA says that the best investments, those most likely to have a return, are the ones that have the long game in mind.\n\nDebt, on the other hand, is a barrier to financial security. Tackling short-term problems shouldn’t come at the expense of long-term stability.\n\nDunn, the economics professor, says, “Becoming debt free is good, but this goal should be balanced against the need to save and invest for retirement.”\n\nSelling Stocks to Pay Off Debt\n\nIf you’re investing, and building for your future, but concerned about a debt load with high interest, it may seem like selling stocks to get rid of the debt is a good idea.\n\nJust as with those who are considering investment, it’s all about the return vs. the payout. If the stocks are building a good financial foundation, you may want to consider debt management or debt consolidation to pay down the debt and keep your nest egg intact and growing.\n\nWithdrawing From 401(k) to Pay Off Debt\n\nWithdrawing from your 401(k) retirement fund to pay off debt is almost never a good idea, Dunn said. “Most economists would not advise the average consumer to cash in a 401k to pay off debt unless there were really unusual circumstances,” she said.\n\nWithdrawing money from your 401(k) comes with hefty penalties and tax payments. Usually, doing it costs you more money than its worth and damages your long-term financial stability.\n\nBorrowing from your 401(k) to pay off credit card debt is a little better, assuming your employer allows it, but with many of the same financial drawbacks.\n\nYou’re paying yourself back, usually at an interest rate that’s a point or two above prime, and the loan doesn’t affect your credit. But the money is taxed twice, both immediately and when it’s withdrawn at retirement; it reduces the amount available for retirement by not building interest; and if you leave your job, you have to pay it back immediately, or pay penalties and taxes.\n\nInstead of using retirement funds to pay off debt, consider credit counseling with an accredited nonprofit agency that can help you look at your finances and figure out what the best route to follow is on debt, including possibly a debt management plan.\n\nOnce the debt is taken care of, there will be extra money to invest to build future financial stability.\n\nJoey Johnston\n\nJoey Johnston has more than 30 years of experience as a journalist with the Tampa Tribune and St. Petersburg Times.

Big things like buying a house, paying for college, and retiring comfortably don’t happen by accident. Neither do little things, like filling your gas tank without worrying it will drain your checking account.\n\nLarge or small, every household has financial needs and goals.\n\n“But a goal without a plan is just a wish,” said Tiana Patillo, a Financial Advisor Manager at Vanguard.\n\nMaking those wishes come true takes study, strategy, and determination. It takes a plan. Having one doesn’t guarantee you won’t face financial failures, but it will certainly make that less likely.\n\nWhat Is a Financial Plan?\n\nA financial plan is an overarching document that establishes your monetary goals and how you will achieve them. It encompasses income, expenses, savings, debt, investments, and all other aspects of your financial picture.\n\nWhat Is the Financial Planning Process?\n\nThere is not a singular way to come up with a financial plan. You can do it yourself, though we’re talking about your financial security here. Unless you are knowledgeable in accounting and investing, you should consider hiring a licensed financial planner.\n\nEither way, the financial planning process usually begins with getting a clear picture of your financial circumstances. Before you go to work, you need to know what you have to work with. Then you should:\n\nEstablish your goals, both short-term and long-term.\n\nDevelop strategies to reach those goals.\n\nImplement those strategies.\n\nKeep track of your progress and alter your strategy as needed.\n\nTypes of Financial Plans\n\nA good plan will encompass all your financial situations. If you have children, you’ll want a plan that addresses college, trade school, or other education expenses.\n\nWhether you want to get out of debt, set yourself up for retirement, prepare for emergencies, or avoid taxes, there should be a strategy to accomplish that goal.\n\nRetirement Planning\n\nMaking sure your golden years aren’t financially tarnished is a big part of most financial plans. To prepare for retirement, you need to save money and invest it during your high-earning years. Do it wisely, and you’ll generate a reliable cash flow until you no longer have any bills.\n\nEducation Planning\n\nThe average cost of an undergraduate degree ranges from $25,707 to $218,00, according to the Education Data Initiative. Whether your kids go to Yale or Yakima State, it takes a while for most people to come up with that kind of money.\n\nSaving for college could include 529 plans, Roth IRAs, student loans, or other programs. Whichever you choose, the faster you start, the better off you and your wallet will be.\n\nDebt Management Planning\n\nIt’s hard to save money when you owe a lot of it. The average balance on credit cards alone was $6,329 in 2024, according to TransUnion.\n\nA debt management plan is designed to consolidate your debts with a lower interest rate and pay them off in 3-5 years. Once you’re out of the hole, you can get serious about building wealth for the future.\n\nTax Planning\n\nAny viable financial plan tries to keep Uncle Sam’s hands off as much money as possible. There are plenty of ways to do it legally, so the IRS won’t hassle you.\n\nHow To Create a Financial Plan\n\nCreating a financial plan is a methodical process. Whether you do it yourself or get help from a financial planner, these steps should get you where you need to go.\n\n1. Set Financial Goals\n\nThis can be the fun part, at least at first. You decide what you want your future to look like, both in the near and far future.\n\nDo you want to take a cruise? Pay off your credit cards? Own a house? Pay for your kid’s college tuition? Drive a Rolls-Royce? Retire to a villa in Monaco?\n\nThe not-so-fun part is realizing how expensive some of those goals are. So be aspirational since it will motivate you to do the things necessary to reach your goals.\n\nBut also, be realistic. Monaco would be fancy-schmancy, but a condo on Panama City Beach wouldn’t be a bad place to retire. Set your financial goals accordingly.\n\n2. Track Your Spending\n\nIt will be hard to reach your financial goals without a clear picture of your finances. Create a budget, which will answer two basic questions.\n\nHow much money do you make? How much money do you spend?\n\nAnd where does that money go?\n\nRent, car payments, utility bills, groceries, Netflix subscriptions, Happy Meals – tracking it all can be a chore. If you need help, there are plenty of money apps that make it easy.\n\nWhichever way you do it, seeing where your cash flows will help you develop strategies to reach your financial goals.\n\n3. Build an Emergency Fund\n\nThe best-laid plans can be destroyed in a blink. A tree could fall on your house. An accident could put you in the hospital. A company could downsize and lay you off.\n\nIf you’re not ready for such shocks, you’ll have to retool your entire financial plan. The best way to get ready is to build an emergency fund.\n\nYou can start small. Try to put away $1,000 so you don’t have to put a brake job or root canal on your credit card. Eventually, you’ll want to put away enough to get you through most emergencies and lean times.\n\n“You should have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses saved in readily accessible investments to help safeguard you when the unexpected occurs,” Patillo said.\n\n4. Reduce Your Debt\n\nDebt means you’ve borrowed money, and borrowed money comes with a price. Interest rates are like a gaping wound on a budget, a 25% gaping wound (or higher) for credit cards or some loans.\n\nThat can add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month. Worrying over how you’ll dig out of the financial hole can also lead to sleepless nights. All of which makes it vital to pay down high-interest debt.\n\nMillions of consumers have attacked the problem with a debt management plan. Credit cards are combined into one monthly payment at a lower interest rate.\n\nSuch programs typically take 3-5 years to complete. It can be time well spent since it will reduce your financial stress. And once you’re out of the hole, you can really start building for the future.\n\n5. Plan for Retirement\n\nRetirement is like Christmas. It always seems far off, and then suddenly it arrives. The problem for many Americans is there won’t be enough money under the retirement tree.\n\nThe typical Gen X household has $40,000 in private retirement plans, according to a study by the National Institute on Retirement. Almost 40% of Gen Xers haven’t saved a penny for retirement.\n\nThat age group, born between 1964 and 1980, came along as the U.S. shifted from traditional pension plans to 401(k) or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) as the primary retirement strategy.\n\nIf you have an employer-sponsored retirement plan in which your company matches part of your contribution, that’s free money. Try to match whatever percentage your employer contributes.\n\n“The most common mistake I see people make is not contributing enough to their retirement accounts,” Patillo said. “Because you can’t borrow for retirement, saving for it is a priority.”\n\nThe do-it-yourself plans have worked out fine for millions of Americans. Millions of others need to get busy, or they might be working until they are put in the ground.\n\n6. Build a Tax Strategy\n\nNo doubt, filing a 1040 Form is an annual headache. A good financial planner can reduce a lot of that pain.\n\nThere are many ways to shelter income through exemptions, deductions, credits, deferred payments, and other programs. A tax expert can find all those legal loopholes that save you a lot of money.\n\n7. Invest to Build Wealth\n\nEverybody dreams of hitting it big in the stock market, and why not? If you’d bought $10,000 worth of Amazon stock in 1997, it would now be worth about $17.8 million.\n\nThe problem is, there aren’t a lot of Amazons out there. That’s not to say stocks and bonds shouldn’t be part of a financial plan. History shows they are a sound investment when managed correctly.\n\nIt can be as simple as investing in your 401(k) plan. Or you can delve more deeply into the stock market.\n\nA lot will depend on your age and how quickly you want to accumulate wealth. If time is on your side, low-risk investments like blue-chip stocks and bonds are probably the way to go. If you need to be more aggressive, a qualified advisor might steer you toward technology or renewable energy stocks.\n\n8. Estate Planning\n\nIf your financial plan works as hoped, you’ll face a big question. What do you want to happen to your wealth when you’re gone, or no longer able to make sound decisions?\n\nDo you donate it to a charitable cause? Set up a trust for the ongoing care of your racehorses and pet chihuahua? Distribute it evenly to your kids, even if one is a struggling missionary and another is a real estate kingpin?\n\nYou need a will that states your final wishes. Other estate-planning documents can spell out how you want to be cared for and who has power of attorney if you can no longer manage your affairs.\n\n9. Monitor and Refine Your Plan\n\nA financial plan should not be chiseled into stone. Be it marriage, kids, health issues, job status — whatever! – the only constant in life is change.\n\nYou will eventually need to tweak, alter, and maybe completely overhaul your financial plan to reflect the changes that come along. Once the changes are made, you need to closely monitor your plan to make sure you’re still on track to meet your financial goals.\n\nBenefits of Financial Planning\n\nFrom motivation to peace of mind, the payoffs are more than monetary with a financial plan. Among them are:\n\nReduces worries over your future.\n\nProvides a clear and detailed account of your financial situation.\n\nAlerts you to unnecessary spending.\n\nBoosts your motivation.\n\nSaves you money on taxes and interest charges.\n\nProvides short- and long-term goals.\n\nIncreases the chances you’ll meet those goals.\n\nStart Your Financial Plan Today\n\nIt might be too late to start a plan that will ensure you’ll retire wealthy or pay for an Ivy League education for all your kids, but it’s never too early to start lining up such goals.\n\nComing up with a plan takes a planner. If you don’t feel up to the job, find somebody who is.\n\nThere are resources available that help you create a budget and stick to it. You may need credit counseling or a debt management program to get out of your money hole and start building a financial future.\n\nJust remember, the future comes fast. As Benjamin Franklin said, if you fail to plan for it, you might as well plan to fail.\n\nTom Jackson\n\nTom Jackson focuses on writing about debt solutions for consumers struggling to make ends meet. His background includes time as a columnist for newspapers in Washington D.C., Tampa and Sacramento, Calif., where he reported and commented on everything from city and state budgets to the marketing of local businesses and how the business of professional sports impacts a city. Along the way, he has racked up state and national awards for writing, editing and design. Tom’s blogging on the 2016 election won a pair of top honors from the Florida Press Club.

As in, $17.8 trillion big. That was the total amount of household debt in the United States in the second quarter of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nHousehold debt isn’t the only thing standing between we collective Americans and financial independence, but $17.8 trillion should give you an indication of how far we are from it. How will we ever get out from under a number that oppressive?\n\nIt’s a good question, and it leads to more pertinent questions about a smaller-picture number, the number your household is contributing to that big-picture debt total. What’s your share of that $17.8 trillion deficit? How much do you owe? And how far are you, as one American, from financial independence?\n\nHere’s a frame of reference: The average total debt balance in this country in 2023 was $104,215. Yes, we called it a “smaller-picture number,” and there’s a good chance it doesn’t feel at all little to you. Again, there are factors other than your personal consumer debt to consider, but even that $104,215 average might have you convinced that autonomy over your money is out of reach.\n\nIt isn’t. You can let your financial freedom ring regardless of how much you’re currently being oppressed by your bottom line.\n\nThere are important, and sometimes difficult steps to take, including reducing that debt amount. But with careful planning and discipline, you can break away from the yoke of money stress and begin to celebrate your personal fiscal independence day.\n\nWhat Is Financial Independence?\n\nFinancial freedom means different things to different people. It might mean the life you want to live without the daily grind of a steady job. It might mean a retirement fund that guarantees your golden years will be as fulfilling as possible. It might mean the confidence that you’ll be able to handle whatever unexpected financial crises crop up. It might mean an escape from the spiral of debt that keeps you from making ends meet.\n\nBut there is a common denominator. In all those cases, financial freedom means an existence without the worries your money (or lack thereof) has been causing you. It means you can wake up every morning untroubled by today’s bills and unconcerned about tomorrow’s expenses. In that sense, financial independence is a state of mind as well as hale and hearty savings.\n\n9 Steps to Financial Independence\n\nFor starters, your path to financial freedom probably will require some painful personal sacrifices. Unless you’re already living frugally, you’ll likely have to cut back on your non-essential spending and find a way to bump up your earnings. That means forgoing some of your guilty pleasures and redirecting some of your precious leisure time and energy to increasing your income.\n\nBut most of the steps to financial independence are less unpleasant than that. They call on you to be disciplined, organized, and educated about your finances, which anyone can do.\n\nLet’s look at how to get out from under all those money problems.\n\n1. Define Your Financial Goals\n\nWe told you earlier that financial independence means different things to different people. Your first step, then, is to decide what it means to you. Is it life without work? A robust retirement? The ability to travel? College education for the kids? Make a list of your financial goals, some timely little ones as well as the big-picture long-term objectives. When you know what your endgame is, you can plot the strategy to get there.\n\n2. Track Your Spending\n\nSpend the next month recording every penny that leaves your possession. Do it daily. Record every outlay, from the monthly rent to the morning donuts. Groceries. Gas. Movies. Beer. Insurance. Phone. If keeping a ledger by hand is too onerous, use a spending tracker app you can find online. After 30 days, you’ll know exactly where your money went. That’s your starting point for deciding how and where to cut back.\n\n3. Create a Budget\n\nYou’re already halfway there because you’ve been tracking your spending. That’s the hard part of creating a budget. The other half is easier — detailing how much money you have coming in, including your take-home pay, social security, pensions, child support, dividend earnings, alimony, and any other wherewithal you take in over the course of the month. When you create a budget, you can see how poorly (or how well!) you’re doing at managing your money. A budget is the best way to spot inefficiencies in your spending habits and show how you can adjust going forward. As with tracking your spending, there are apps for budgeting.\n\n4. Reduce Your Debt\n\nYou can’t just snap your fingers and magically make your debts vanish, but you can be sensible about how you attack the balances on your credit cards and loans. One way is the debt snowball method, in which you rank the amounts you owe from lowest to highest and work toward eliminating the smallest balance first by paying as much as you can on it every month (while continuing to pay the minimum on the other balances) When that one is paid off, move on to the next one. Another is the debt avalanche method, in which you rank your debts by the size of their interest rates and start by paying as much as you can on the one that carries the highest rate, working down your list that way. Or consider debt consolidation, which reduces the number of payments you make every month and lowers the interest you pay at the same time. However you do it, you’ll eventually see the bottom-line benefits.\n\n5. Set Up Automatic Savings\n\nIt’s the best way to make sure you save money regularly. By automatically transferring some of your regular paycheck into a savings account, you won’t have to remember to do it manually. And because you won’t have immediate access to the amount you’ve automatically directed to savings, you’ll be less tempted to spend it at a restaurant, a movie, a boutique, or in some other non-essential way. Most savings accounts allow you to earn interest on money you put into them. You can maximize the interest rate on those deposits by directly transferring a portion of your earnings into a high-yield savings account or a brokerage account.\n\n6. Start Investing\n\nInvesting is one of the best ways to make your money work for you. Yes, it can be risky, but patience and a diversified investment portfolio minimizes the danger and maximizes your steady progress toward your financial goals. Remember when we said the keys to becoming financially independent include becoming educated and organized about your money? An online brokerage account will help you with both. As you make regular contributions to it, your brokerage account will teach you how to be a smart investor and how to structure your portfolio to ratchet up your returns. For example, a brokerage account will help you diversify, which protects you from the high risk of a single stock investment that can come with a bigger payoff but also cause greater damage to your bottom line.\n\n7. Live Below Your Means\n\nThis is a no-brainer step. It’s also one of the hardest steps if you’re accustomed to buying what you want when you want it. The goal is to make sure you’re making more money than you’re spending. When you do that, you’ll have a surplus every month that you can save in a way that moves you closer to your financial goals. That, after all, is why you created a budget back at Step No. 3. It’s your road map to living below your means.\n\n8. Monitor Your Credit Score\n\nDon’t take anything for granted, including the benefits of a good credit score. The three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) that compile information from lenders, creditors, and public records to create your credit score aren’t infallible. A 2024 study by USA Today said that 44% of the people who read their credit report, find errors. If the reporting agencies get something wrong or if you’ve been a victim of identity theft, your score can drop through no fault of your own. That can slow down your steady march to financial independence when you’re applying for a new credit card, mortgage, auto loan, or insurance and discover you can’t afford the borrowing rate. It’s easy to monitor your credit score. Your credit card companies, or other lenders, often include your credit score on their statements or make it available through your online account. Plus, each of the three bureaus must give you a free credit report every year. All you need to do is ask!\n\n9. Increase Your Income\n\nThis is another big challenge. Chances are, you already think you work hard enough and don’t have the bandwidth for a part-time job or a side hustle. But finding ways to augment the income side of your monthly budget will move you toward financial independence in several meaningful ways. You’ll have more money to pay off debt. You’ll find it easier to live below your means. You’ll be able to make bigger contributions to your online brokerage account. So, ask for that raise. Look into side jobs. Start your own craft or service business out of your home in the evenings. Hold a garage or yard sale. It can be done. Commit to it!\n\nBegin Your Journey to Financial Independence\n\nThere’s your road map: nine steps to financial freedom. Simple, right?\n\nBut it isn’t simple, of course. This route isn’t an as-the-crow-flies straight line. You’ll no doubt run into detours along the way. You’ll likely encounter unexpected expenses that throw your budget off kilter. Maybe some of your investments go belly-up. Could be your financial goals change as time goes by and you’ll have to adjust your strategy to meet them. Any number of things can slow your progress.\n\nDon’t despair. When roadblocks get in the way, don’t be afraid to reach out for help. If you’re struggling financially, seek out credit counseling from a nonprofit credit counseling agency. During a session with a counselor, you’ll be provided with a personalized budget review, an analysis of your debt, and recommendations for an action plan. You’ll also be presented with debt relief alternatives to get you back on track.\n\nFinancial freedom might seem a long way off, but remember the two key essentials to making it happen: having a plan, and exercising discipline. If you keep them in mind, you won’t lose sight of your destination.\n\nAnd when you reach it, feel free to throw yourself a parade. It’s your Independence Day, after all.\n\nMichael Knisley\n\nMichael Knisley writes about managing your personal finances for InCharge Debt Solutions.

Every time you turn on the TV there are ads for everything from financial firms that will guide your money to the perfect investment, to phone apps that make investing easy with a couple quick swipes.\n\nYou don’t want to miss out, but you have debt – credit cards, student loans, maybe a mortgage. You may wonder, which is the better financial move – investing or paying off debt?\n\nThe two financial moves are apples and oranges.\n\n“For most people, debt is a separate function from investment,” Lucia Dunn, a professor of economics at Ohio State University, said. “Investments carry risks that need to be considered.”\n\nInvesting money, particularly in the stock market, doesn’t guarantee you will make money, or even how much you will make. Dunn said that most economists would advise a person in the median income range not to deviate from their normal repayment patterns for debt obligations in order to invest.\n\nThat said,  investing while paying off debt, or paying off debt, then investing, may still be a good move.\n\nShould You Pay Off Credit Cards or Invest?\n\nIf you’re considering investing, “It always makes sense to pay off the debt with the highest interest charges first,” Dunn said.\n\nThat means credit cards. Credit card interest rates  in  2021 average about 16.65%. The lower your credit score, the higher your interest rates. If you don’t pay the cards off every month, you might be closer to 30%.\n\nDespite the fluctuation, credit card interest rates are a lot easier to predict that the stock market. While there are crazy highs and lows on stocks and mutual funds, the average rate of return on stock investing over the past several decades is 8-to-10% a year. The average credit card interest rate, on the other hand, has steadily risen and in recent years has been between 16 and 18%.\n\nSo, it’s better to pay off high-interest credit cards, or at least lower the interest rates, before spending money on investing.\n\nOne way to get rates down is to get your credit score up, which means making payments on time and lowering your “utilization rate” (how much credit you’re allowed vs. how much you use).\n\nIf that seems hard to do on your own, you may want to consider a debt management program or debt consolidation.\n\nDebt Management Plan\n\nA debt management plan with a nonprofit credit counseling agency consolidates credit card debt and lowers the amount of interest you’re paying on it. You make one affordable monthly payment to the agency,  to eliminate credit card debt. The agency distributes the money to your lenders at an agreed-upon rate that pays off the debt in 3-5 years.  Your credit score improves as payments are made on time and the amount you owe shrinks. Debt management plans come with a monthly administrative fee of $30-$50.\n\nDebt Consolidation to Improve Credit\n\nDebt consolidation involves getting a loan that has lower interest and using it to pay off your credit cards. The loan can be secured, meaning you use an asset, like your house, as collateral to get a lower interest rate. Or it can be an unsecured personal loan, which has no collateral, but a higher interest rate. If your debt consolidation loan has a lower interest rate than the average return on investment, you may want to start investing the money that would normally be going to pay that high interest.\n\nShould You Pay Off Student Loans or Invest?\n\nMost people who take out student loans borrow through the federal program, which has fixed interest rates between 2.75% and 5.3%. Private student loans have more of a range, as high as 12.99% for fixed and 11.98% for variable, which means the rate can change for better or worse.\n\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has put a pause on collecting student loan payments until at least October 2021, and interest won’t accrue during that period. Borrowers can still pay if they want to, with the entire payment being applied to reducing the principal during the 0% interest period.\n\nThere is no such pause on private loans – it’s up to the lender, and payments can change suddenly for those with variable interest.\n\nMany experts urge borrowers to pay back their loans, and to take advantage of the no interest period if they can to get the principal down. While there’s no guaranteed return on investments, there is one on paying back loans, particularly paying more than the principal.\n\nShould You Pay Off Your House or Invest\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate, with points, was 3.08% for those with excellent credit scores in 2021. Mortgage rates tend to be much lower than the rate on return for investments. On top of it, paying a mortgage is one of the surest investments you can make.\n\nThe longer you pay, the more equity you have in your home. Assuming you make payments on time, a mortgage is a tremendous boost to your credit score and history.\n\n“(Mortgages) not only usually carry a low interest rate, but gradually becomes an asset over time and can be used as collateral to finance other things down the road, like children’s education,” Dunn said. “So, paying off a mortgage at the usual rate makes sense unless a person suddenly gets a windfall – like winning the lottery.”\n\nShould You Use Investments to Pay Off Debt?\n\nInvestments are a way to build financial security in the long term and most economic experts stress that the idea is to let them build, ignoring fluctuations and looking at the end goal.\n\nWhen investing, it’s important to assess the risk, something that all investments have, to make sure you’re not going to lose money. “Even conservative, insured investments, such as certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by a bank or credit union, come with inflation risk,” the Financial Industry Regulatory Association (FINRA) warns. “They may not earn enough over time to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.” FINRA says that the best investments, those most likely to have a return, are the ones that have the long game in mind.\n\nDebt, on the other hand, is a barrier to financial security. Tackling short-term problems shouldn’t come at the expense of long-term stability.\n\nDunn, the economics professor, says, “Becoming debt free is good, but this goal should be balanced against the need to save and invest for retirement.”\n\nSelling Stocks to Pay Off Debt\n\nIf you’re investing, and building for your future, but concerned about a debt load with high interest, it may seem like selling stocks to get rid of the debt is a good idea.\n\nJust as with those who are considering investment, it’s all about the return vs. the payout. If the stocks are building a good financial foundation, you may want to consider debt management or debt consolidation to pay down the debt and keep your nest egg intact and growing.\n\nWithdrawing From 401(k) to Pay Off Debt\n\nWithdrawing from your 401(k) retirement fund to pay off debt is almost never a good idea, Dunn said. “Most economists would not advise the average consumer to cash in a 401k to pay off debt unless there were really unusual circumstances,” she said.\n\nWithdrawing money from your 401(k) comes with hefty penalties and tax payments. Usually, doing it costs you more money than its worth and damages your long-term financial stability.\n\nBorrowing from your 401(k) to pay off credit card debt is a little better, assuming your employer allows it, but with many of the same financial drawbacks.\n\nYou’re paying yourself back, usually at an interest rate that’s a point or two above prime, and the loan doesn’t affect your credit. But the money is taxed twice, both immediately and when it’s withdrawn at retirement; it reduces the amount available for retirement by not building interest; and if you leave your job, you have to pay it back immediately, or pay penalties and taxes.\n\nInstead of using retirement funds to pay off debt, consider credit counseling with an accredited nonprofit agency that can help you look at your finances and figure out what the best route to follow is on debt, including possibly a debt management plan.\n\nOnce the debt is taken care of, there will be extra money to invest to build future financial stability.\n\nJoey Johnston\n\nJoey Johnston has more than 30 years of experience as a journalist with the Tampa Tribune and St. Petersburg Times.

When you buy via links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission at no cost to you.\n\nGreat question. There are pros and cons to both.\n\nA business would help you grow your income faster than most passive income options. But it also requires a lot more work and skill.\n\nHow much skill do you already have in launching &amp; scaling a business on a scale of 1-10?\n\nIf your estimate is in the lower half and you need the business income to pay some or all of your expenses soon, I would personally prefer the passive income option.\n\nThis is not an either or question per se. Saying no to starting a business can just be &quot;not now&quot; or &quot;not first&quot;.\n\nSkip Ahead\n\nToggle\n\nWhy It's Easier to Generate Income From Passive Assets Than Starting a Business\n\nDon't you need a lot of money available for investment to create meaningful amounts of passive income?\n\nNot really. But here is where the mindset shifts come in. I can think of 5+ different ways to create passive income with $0 to invest.\n\nBut I did not know any of them 15 years ago.\n\nLet's review a few (not financial advice):\n\n1. Get a 0% balance transfer credit card\n\nYou can pay most of your bills with it for the next 2-3 months. The amount you &quot;save&quot; can be transferred to an investment account. \n\nUse the funds to invest in stocks with high dividends (5-10% ROI) or sell stock options with a smart strategy (45-90% ROI).\n\n2. Take Out a Personal Loan With a Reasonable Interest Rate\n\nWhen I got into a financial crunch with living abroad and owning two rental real estate properties in my home country, I was able to cover it with a personal loan at a flexible rate of approximately 7% at the time.\n\nYou can also use such a loan for investments in a way similar to how I described in #1 or as a way to help with a down payment for #3.\n\nBe careful though: banks usually require the down payment to come from savings or investments. So you might need to plan ahead for this strategy or use a gift form your spouse or relative who's not on the mortgage.\n\n3. Buy a Real Estate Asset With 95-100% Financing and Rent it Out\n\nLoans with such a low down payment are usually available for first time home buyers and/or people with a good credit history. They commonly require owner occupancy.\n\nYou can live in the property for a while and rent out all other rooms until you're ready to move (some people do the same with the next property).\n\nThere are many more options like this, which are not immediately obvious, nor known by most people.\n\nReal estate sales contracts and business acquisitions with $0 down are other examples. Put a search for this in YouTube or Google if you're curious.\n\nIt's always good to invest in our financial education and follow our curiosity (while being street smart).\n\nWhat's Your Decision? \n\nWill you move forward with launching / scaling a business or creating more passive income (first)?\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the 45-90% ROI options strategy I mentioned above, please visit:\n\nhttps://grow.saltmoney.org/guide\n\nto access our FREE guide.\n\nThis is the main strategy I use today to grow my passive income.

When you buy via links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission at no cost to you.\n\nReturn on Investment (ROI) is a crucial metric that measures the profitability of an investment relative to its cost. It is a key indicator of the success and efficiency of an investment, providing investors with valuable insights into the potential returns they can expect.\n\nWhile many investors may believe that achieving a high ROI is a daunting task, the reality is that earning 25-50% annual ROI is easier than we think. I've personally discovered and implemented four different ways to achieve this level of ROI and look forward to sharing them with you.\n\nBy exploring investment opportunities with high ROI potential, understanding the key factors influencing high ROI investments, and implementing effective strategies, everyone can unlock the potential for higher returns.\n\nSkip Ahead\n\nToggle\n\nHow to Identify Investment Opportunities with High ROI Potential\n\nTo achieve a high ROI, it is essential to utilize investment opportunities that have the potential to generate substantial returns. One such opportunity lies in the realm of startups and early-stage companies.\n\nThese ventures often offer high growth potential, as they are in their nascent stages and have the ability to disrupt industries. By investing in promising startups, investors can tap into the exponential growth that these companies can experience, leading to significant returns on their investment.\n\nI've personally only achieved this level of return in startups I was actively participating in myself. To achieve these returns through a passive investment, we had to spread our funds in a lot of different promising startups in the past (also known as angel investing).\n\nThis required a lot of investable assets since most companies have an minimum investment size greater than $1,000. In some cases the minimum can be as high as $50,000.\n\nToday we have sites like Republic, MicroVentures, and StartEngine which allow investment sizes as low as $100.\n\nAnother avenue for high ROI potential lies in real estate investments. Real estate has long been considered a safe and lucrative investment option. By carefully selecting properties in high-demand areas or emerging markets, investors can benefit from both rental income and property appreciation.\n\nAdditionally, investing in real estate through crowdfunding platforms or real estate investment trusts (REITs) provides an opportunity for diversification and access to a wider range of properties.\n\nFundrise, YieldStreet, and CrowdStreet are populate options in this space.\n\nBut I want to take a few minutes to introduce you to my two favorite options for earning 25-50% annual ROI. They both require less than 30 minutes a week to monitor and/or manage the investment.\n\nTwo Underutilized Ways to Earn 25-50% Annual ROI by Investing in Stocks\n\nLet's take a look at a systematic way to earn this kind of return from stocks first. It has to do with utilizing stock options in a way most people are not familiar with.\n\nThe majority of investors who use options buy them in the hope for a significant upward or downward price movement of the underlying stock. But my favorite way to earn income from stocks is to sell options instead.\n\nWe highly recommend running this strategy in paper mode for several weeks first while tracking your progress in a spreadsheet.\n\nThe strategy consists of 5 basic steps:\n\nFirst you have to choose stocks with a risk and opportunity profile you understand enough to be okay with owning them long-term. Next you need to make sure you can have enough funds to buy at least 100 shares of a stock you want to start this strategy with.\n\nIf your funds don't fit this criteria based on the initial list of stocks you chose, you need to either research stocks with a lower share price which meet your risk/opportunity requirements or save more funds to invest.\n\nOnce you found the first stock you want to use this strategy with, you start by selling a put option below the current price with an expiration date of roughly one week.\n\nThe option should have a strike price below the current stock price and the premium you collect by selling the option should be at least 1% of the stock price.\n\nIf the option expires without being assigned by the end of the week, you've made a nice 1% return for one week. Assuming this would work out every week you would be able to achieve over 52% of ROI, even before considering the implications of compounding for this strategy.\n\nBut don't fret if your option got assigned by the end of the week. In that case you just sell a call option for the price of your assigned put option (or higher) and keep repeating this step until the call option gets assigned.\n\nFor this step we also want to aim for ~1% of weekly return on the premium. But it's okay if the return is a little lower or we need to switch to options with a two or four week expiration date (and 2-4% return ideally) to achieve this.\n\nSometimes the price moves so far below the strike price of your put option that you'll be unable to sell a call option with a significant premium for a while. That's okay because we chose the stocks for this strategy based on the fact that we're okay with owning them for the long term.\n\nOnce the stock price recovers, we can get back to selling call options until they get assigned and our circular process described above continues. This strategy is called the Wheel Options Strategy. You'll be able to find several books and YouTube videos about it, if you'd like to learn more.\n\nLet's see how we can achieve a similar return by investing in crypto.\n\n25-50% ROI From Automated Investing in Cryptocurrencies\n\nA very convenient way to earn passive income from cryptocurrencies are automated investing strategies using grid bots and dollar cost averaging (DCA) bots.\n\nWhen setting up these bots you simple define a price range you expect the bot to move around in over the next several months. The bot will then generate steady returns for you by buying low and selling high.\n\nState-of-the-art bot platforms also support trailing up and down the grid in case the price moves outside of the initially defined range.\n\nBacktesting these strategies is highly recommending when starting a new bot. The biggest risk comes from the cryptocurrency losing significant value and not recovering for a long time.\n\nThis risk is most pronounced for coins with smaller market cap as well as for larger coins during crypto winters. By selecting coins from the top 10, 20, 50, or 100 and studying the fundamentals of the coin's technology and value proposition we can manage these risks.\n\nVisit GridPortfolio.com to learn more about these innovative passive income strategies.\n\nKey Factors Influencing High ROI Investments\n\nSeveral key factors influence the potential for high ROI investments. Firstly, thorough research and due diligence are essential. Investors must analyze the market, industry trends, and the financial health of the investment opportunity.\n\nBy understanding the potential risks and rewards, investors can make informed decisions and increase their chances of achieving a high ROI.\n\nFurthermore, timing plays a crucial role in high ROI investments. Identifying opportunities before they become mainstream allows investors to capitalize on early-stage growth.\n\nThis requires staying updated with market trends, technological advancements, and emerging industries. By being proactive and forward-thinking, investors can position themselves for maximum returns.\n\nValue-Based Strategies to Achieve 25-50% Annual ROI\n\nTo achieve a 25-50% annual ROI, investors must adopt effective strategies. One such strategy is value investing, which involves identifying undervalued assets and investing in them for the long term.\n\nBy purchasing assets below their intrinsic value, investors can benefit from their eventual appreciation, leading to substantial returns.\n\nAnother strategy is active trading, where investors actively buy and sell assets to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations.\n\nThis strategy requires in-depth market knowledge, technical analysis skills, and the ability to make quick decisions. While it can be more volatile and risky, active trading can yield high returns if executed correctly.\n\nCase Studies: Real-Life Examples of Successful High ROI Investments\n\nReal-life examples of successful high ROI investments serve as inspiration and proof that achieving 25-50% annual ROI is indeed possible.\n\nOne such example is the early investment in Amazon. In 1997, when Amazon went public, its stock was priced at $18 per share. Today, it trades at over $3,000 per share, resulting in an astronomical ROI for early investors.\n\nAnother example is the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, experienced exponential growth in recent years.\n\nThose who invested in Bitcoin early on have seen remarkable returns, with the cryptocurrency reaching an all-time high of nearly $74,000 per coin in Q2 of 2024.\n\nMitigating Risks and Maximizing Returns: Expert Tips and Advice\n\nWhile the potential for high ROI is enticing, it is crucial to mitigate risks and maximize returns. Expert tips and advice can help investors navigate the investment landscape more effectively.\n\nOne key tip is to diversify investments across different asset classes and industries. This spreads the risk and increases the chances of capturing high-performing investments while minimizing potential losses.\n\nAdditionally, staying informed and continuously learning about investment strategies and market trends is essential.\n\nBy keeping up with industry news, attending seminars, and seeking advice from experienced professionals, investors can make more informed decisions and increase their chances of achieving higher returns.\n\nIt is helpful to consider Mind-Blowing Passive Income Ideas Most People Don't Know in 2024 when optimizing the annual ROI of your investment portfolio.\n\nDiversification: The Key to Consistent High ROI\n\nDiversification is a fundamental principle in achieving consistent high ROI. By spreading investments across various asset classes, industries, and geographical locations, investors can reduce the impact of market volatility and minimize the risk of losing their entire investment.\n\nDiversification allows investors to capture opportunities in different sectors and benefit from the growth of multiple assets simultaneously.\n\nConclusion: Unlocking the Potential for Higher ROI\n\nEarning 25-50% annual ROI is indeed within reach for investors who are willing to explore high ROI investment opportunities, understand the key factors influencing returns, and implement effective strategies.\n\nBy conducting thorough research, staying informed, and diversifying their investments, investors can mitigate risks and maximize their chances of achieving higher returns.\n\nReal-life examples of successful high ROI investments serve as inspiration and proof that with the right approach, earning substantial returns is not as challenging as it may seem. So, let us embrace the potential for higher ROI and unlock the doors to financial success.\n\nMarkus Braasch\n\nAfter growing up in Germany I decided to take a brief break from entrepreneurship to study in the US.

When you buy via links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission at no cost to you.\n\nMany people dream about financial independence. A lot of us take steps towards it at different parts of our journey. Sooner or later we achieve degrees of it as long as we don't give up. Along the path I discovered a number of levers which make all the difference in avoiding mistakes and helping us become financially independent faster.\n\nBy adjusting even a single of these levers we will see tremendous improvement in the speed of our journey to financial freedom. But truly mind-blowing results can be achieved when we combine them together, as we'll see in a few moments.\n\nSkip Ahead\n\nToggle\n\n1st Lever: Living Below Our Means to Become Financially Independent\n\nSpending less than we earn is really powerful but can be hard to implement once we've gotten used to a certain lifestyle. We have two basic options:\n\nReduce our spending\n\nIncrease our income (without increasing our spending)\n\nMost of us would prefer the second option, but let's consider reducing our spending first. This can be done by downsizing a bit. We can postpone the purchase of a new car for example, as long as the maintenance bills of the current one are less than a new car payment would be. Reducing Starbucks, Amazon, dining, streaming memberships, etc. can be another way to help our budget out.\n\nThe only area I would not skimp on here is health related expenses like food, doctor visits, and gym memberships (if we use them).\n\nOne thing I really recommend is committing to keep our spending mostly the same after the next promotion or when we switch to a better paying job. This virtue is called moderation and will lead to a growing amount of cash flow we can sow into our assets column for savings &amp; investments.\n\nIf we think the next pay raise is too far off or not significant enough, we can also consider a side hustle. I utilized this myself for a while by creating a simple profile on upwork.com with a description of my skills and an hourly rate which provided a good value for both sides.\n\nOnce I had the first freelancing tasks &amp; projects under my belt with a positive review, I increased my hourly rate gradually over the years until it was 4-5x of what I started with. Upwork and related sites will promote your profile at no extra charge, since it's a win/win/win for all parties involved.\n\n2nd Lever: Using Low Interest to Pay Off or Earn High Interest\n\nMaybe we have credit card debt with an interest rate &gt; 10% or a car loan with significantly higher rate than our mortgage. Credit Card balances can oftentimes be transferred to a card with 0% interest for 12 months or we can consider a personal loan with lower interest to help us pay the balance off faster.\n\nRefinancing our mortgage at a lower rate or getting a low interest home equity line of credit can help pay off car and other loans with higher interest rates. Please make sure not just to increase your debt here, but follow through on reducing all balances with high interest rates as soon as possible.\n\nWhen deciding between a mortgage with 15 or 30 year loan term I would recommend not just looking at obtaining the best rate. If the 30-year rate is significantly below the average return of a reliable index fund like the S&amp;P 500 and you have 10+ years until your planned retirement, it is usually better to choose the longer term to have more funds available for investing.\n\nWe just need to prioritize paying ourselves first (by investing in cash-flow generating assets) before increasing our spending &amp; lifestyle. \n\n3rd Lever: Mindset Shift - Don't Work for Money\n\nSmart people let money work for them instead of spending valuable time working for money. Time is our most valuable asset. We can always earn more money, but we can never get back the time we spent.\n\nI recommend studying how to do this, having conversations with ChatGPT about it, reading books, attending courses, doing whatever it takes. The time you spend here will be one of the best investments you can make for your life.\n\nOnce we have a new perspective, it becomes much easier to take action steps towards the direction we want to go. \n\n4th Lever: Create Passive Income Strategically\n\nThis leads us to the importance of creating passive income. Letting money work for you will result in money coming into your bank account while we work and while we sleep. It allows us to move from a 9-5 job to 24x7 income that does not cost our time.\n\nWouldn't it feel great to only accept a job because we want to, not because we have to in order to pay our bills? This is possible with passive income. It's okay to start small. We can build and grow it gradually.\n\nFor creative examples on how to achieve this practically, I would like to invite you to read two great articles we published on this topic recently:\n\nBuilding Wealth on Autopilot: The Best Passive Income Ideas for 2024\n\nMind-Blowing Passive Income Ideas Most People Don't Know in 2024\n\n5th Lever: Give Your Best Insights Away\n\nWe know good things come to us when we do good to other people. One of the most strategic and somewhat counterintuitive things we can do in life is to give our best insights away for free. We can do this in personal conversations, social media, blogs, newsletters, or video.\n\nThe opportunities are endless in the age we live in. Giving our best insights away helps us to build an audience. People who connect with what we share will wait for the next piece we have to give to them.\n\nAs this audience grows with our consistent generosity in sharing what helped us, we're creating opportunities for a return. People will sometimes just do something good for us we don't expect, like recommending us for an open job position in the company they work for.\n\nThis also creates opportunities to create and publish a short course or mini e-book. Our audience will usually not mind parting with some of their money to get access to something valuable that helps them get to the next level they're trying to reach.\n\nAffiliate marketing, paid sponsored posts, and higher ticket offers like coaching are other options we can consider.\n\nYour Breakthrough Moment: Mind-Blowing Results from Combining All Levers\n\nBy combining all five we dramatically increase the speed to reach (a new level of) financial freedom exponentially, like factors in a formula of multiplication:\n\n1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 = 1\n\nIf we leave all levers in their standard setting we will just continue to move forward at the speed of 1. But watch what happens if we manage to increase these levers by just 50% each:\n\n1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 = 7.59x\n\nNow we're suddenly moving at more than 7 times the speed! Isn't that amazing. How much would that help you achieve the goals and dreams you've already started to give up on?\n\nLet's look at what is possible if we double our efforts in each of these areas:\n\n2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32x\n\nUnbelievable - we're now moving at 32 times the speed we started with. This is what's possible when we invest strategically in all of these areas and become financially independent. We can't wait to hear your story on how this impacted your life and what you achieved for yourself and your family as a result.\n\nMarkus Braasch\n\nAfter growing up in Germany I decided to take a brief break from entrepreneurship to study in the US.

A former book editor and University of Michigan alum, she divides her time between the page and parenting in Seattle, Washington.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nFinancial independence is defined differently for all of us.\n\nTake steps towards financial independence by building a budget, investing in financial education, and finding inspiration.\n\nFinancial independence is not an endpoint; it is a continuous commitment to yourself.\n\nIndependence has unique context and meaning for each of us. Regardless of what label best fits this particular stage in your life—employee, parent, student, teacher, or traveler—having a sense of financial safety makes a big impact on the quality of our life. We all deserve to feel secure in our financial future.\n\nIf you’re anxious about high interest credit card debt,  your credit health, or even just habits that haven’t served you, financial independence for you might mean alleviating that worry. Here are three (free!) resources that can move you closer to financial independence—wherever you’re at.\n\nBuild a Budget\n\nWe talk about budgeting a lot here at GreenPath: why it’s important and how to build one. A realistic budget is what allows us to take control of our money and allocate it in a way that aligns with our big picture goals and values. But budgeting isn’t just about creating rigid limitations; it’s about making intentional choices that move us closer to our money milestones and lessen future anxiety.\n\nIf you like starting with a loose framework, consider the 50/30/20 model: allocate 50% of your income to essential needs like rent and groceries, 30% to wants for entertainment and dining out, and 20% towards savings and debt repayment. This method ensures your essential needs are met, allows some flexibility for fun, and keeps you moving toward long-term financial goals.\n\nCrunch the numbers with GreenPath's budget calculator.\n\nCalculate Budget\n\nCalculate Budget\n\nInvest in Financial Education\n\nIn high school, we learn geography, algebra,  and social studies, but did you ever have a course on how to finance a car or navigate student loans? As adults, many of us learn to manage our money simply by doing, but with free online education, learning best practices is as simple as picking up your smartphone.\n\nWhen it comes to achieving financial independence, having an educational foundation can simplify the process of home purchase. Or help determine which debt repayment path is right for you. Wherever your priority lies, be proactive in seeking the knowledge that can move you closer to your end goals.\n\nTake a free financial course with LearningLab.\n\nTake a free financial course with LearningLab+.\n\nTake Course\n\nTake Course\n\nGet Inspired\n\nChances are, if you’re not struggling in our current economy, you know someone who is. But how often are any of us candid about the mental or emotional barriers we face?\n\nCreating a realistic budget and investing in your financial knowledge can strengthen your financial foundation, but there’s something else that brings peace of mind: knowing your burden is shared. Whether it’s the father who grappled with crippling law school debt or the woman who overcame financial abuse, there is solace in hearing firsthand that endings are often better beginnings in disguise.\n\nTune into Real $tories, a podcast about financial wellness.\n\nListen Now\n\nListen Now\n\nBy tapping into financial resources—either those we’ve highlighted here or others—you’ve taken the first pivotal step towards declaring your financial independence. Stay focused and forgive yourself when setbacks occur. Stay connected with like-minded individuals who can provide support and accountability where you need it. Celebrate your progress along the way, no matter how small.\n\nFinancial independence is not an endpoint; it’s a continuous commitment yourself to be mindful with your money, prioritize the goals that matter most, and create a life that honors your definition of fulfillment.\n\nGreenPath counselors can help you set up a spending plan.

But are Americans’ finances healthier because of it? – USA Today\n\nJuly 2, 2019\n\nBy: Greenpath Financial Wellness\n\nGreenPath Financial Wellness is a trusted national nonprofit with more than 60-years of helping people build financial health and resiliency. Our NFCC-certified counselors give you options to manage credit card debt, student loans and homeownership.\n\nFeaturing Dawn Hudson, GreenPath Financial Expert\n\nThis is the first story in a series about Americans’ financial health based on a survey provided by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to financial education and empowerment.\n\nIf you had to grade the U.S. economy today, it would probably get straight As.\n\nThe country is a month short of the longest economic expansion ever. Unemployment is at 50-year lows. Stocks notched the longest bull market last year and are again nearing fresh highs. And U.S. home values hit a record high in the first quarter.\n\nBut a survey of Americans finds their individual financial security is less clear than those collective high points suggest.\n\nIn many areas, fortunes have greatly improved compared with years past. But Americans remain stressed about money, and only a minority are satisfied with their financial position, according to the 2018 Financial Capability Study from FINRA Investor Education Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to financial education and empowerment.\n\nUSA TODAY was given an exclusive look at the survey on financial capability, which considers people’s ability to make ends meet, plan ahead, manage financial products and understand financial concepts. The results will be released later Thursday.\n\n“I give our nation’s financial capability a solid C, leaning toward a C-minus,” says Gerri Walsh, president of the FINRA Foundation. “While some Americans feel better about their finances now compared with 10 years ago, too many face obstacles that will likely keep us as a nation from acing financial capability any time soon.”\n\nConducted every three years since its 2009 inception, the study surveyed more than 27,000 respondents nationwide online, measuring key indicators of financial capability.\n\nRead the entire article here at USA Today.\n\n \n\nLet’s Make a Plan Together\n\nGreenPath offers free financial counseling and education to support people in their financial health and meeting their goals.  Our professional, caring financial coaches will work with you to assess your situation, explain the options or solutions available, and help you create a spending plan to meet your goals.

Our NFCC-certified counselors give you options to manage credit card debt, student loans and homeownership.\n\nAs interest rates increase and prices for everyday items continue to move higher, many people are looking to make their money go farther, save more, or make their financial life easier. You might also look to manage consumer debt as part of your overall financial picture.\n\nA financial life hack refers to a simple and effective way to manage your money better and achieve your goals faster without a lot of extra effort. While there are no true shortcuts when it comes to financial health and wellness, it can be helpful to take simple actions or habits that, when applied consistently, can lead to improvements in your financial well-being.\n\nWe’ve learned many tips over the years through talking with clients who face some of the same challenges you might be experiencing. Here are some of our favorite – and simple — “financial life hacks” you can do to improve your financial life.\n\n1. Dig into Your Debt\n\nOne of the most powerful financial life hacks is to save money on interest. Look at what you’re paying each month in high interest credit card debt. To understand the best approach to reducing interest fees, work with a trusted national financial counseling organization like GreenPath. Caring, certified counselors will take the time to understand your full financial picture and suggest debt payoff options that work for you.\n\n2. Set up a Dedicated Spending Account\n\nSet up a dedicated account to automate payment of your monthly recurring bills, such as rent or mortgage, utilities, cell phone bills, internet and other expenses. This not only simplifies the bill paying process, it also provides a way to “set it and forget it” when you automate a transfer deposit into the account each time you are paid. So if you are paid twice a month, split the number needed to cover all your expenses in half for two monthly automated deposits. You’ll reduce the chance for late feels, simplify your monthly administration tasks, and gain peace of mind when it comes to paying those monthly bills.\n\n3. Delete Payment Info from Online Stores\n\nPart of the reason why online stores are so successful is because they make your purchasing experience as frictionless as possible. One way they do this is by storing your credit card information so you can conveniently “one-click.” By deleting your credit card, you create an added barrier to impulse shopping that will make you less likely to spend unnecessarily.\n\n4: Carry (and use) Cash\n\nOne of the downsides of debit and credit cards is that it makes spending seamless. This makes impulse buying that much easier, which can prevent you from keeping up with your financial goals. Studies show that people spend less when they carry cash, particularly bills that are hard to break, like $50s and $100s. To kick it up a notch, make sure to ask for new bills. The crispness makes you less likely to want to spend on unnecessary items.\n\nGreenPath counselors can help you set up a spending plan. Call today to speak with an expert for free.\n\n 800-550-1961\n\n877-337-3399\n\n5. Carry Your Purchases\n\nReduce the urge to overspend when you visit grocery, clothing or other stores when you opt out of using a grocery cart and physically carry your purchases. This is because the size of a shopping cart creates a psychological desire to fill it. To prevent this, opt to carry a basket rather than the cart. You’ll be less tempted to overspend.\n\n6. Switch On LED Lights\n\nSome people are intimidated by the higher upfront cost of LED light bulbs, but you also have to think about the long-term energy cost savings. LED light bulbs last 10 times as long as incandescent and they use about 20% of the energy. You may end up saving $100 over a single bulb’s lifetime.\n\n7. Check Out Your Local Library\n\nIf you are a bookworm, a financial life hack is to make your hobby completely free. Rather than spend $25 or more per book, check it out from your local library. In a book club? Many libraries offer book club kits and reading guides, or will even order the book you want for their permanent collection. Libraries also offer free, family- friendly programming that you can take advantage of for family entertainment.\n\n8. Buy (and Sell) Used\n\nA tried and true financial life hack is to buy used instead of new. Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, neighborhood websites, yard sales, and consignment shops are great sources for gently used items like furniture, home décor, clothes, tools or even electronic devices. Have a nearly-new piece of furniture or clothing you no longer use? Consider selling your own items to make extra money.\n\n9. Plan Your Meals\n\nOne place where people consistently overspend is by using online home delivery and takeout meals. Instead of spending $20-$25 per meal for delivered food, plan homemade meals that are quick and easy. You’ll save big bucks, particularly if you use leftovers from the night before. Cutting down on take out and food delivery can easily save you $1,000 per year!\n\n10. Get Free Guidance\n\nYou are not alone when it comes to improving financial health and wellness. Remember, there’s no single way to achieve financial health. It’s a journey as unique as each individual is. However, there’s a lot you can learn from people who have been in your shoes before. Connect with a caring GreenPath counselor for a free counseling session. We’ll work to understand your specific challenges to uncover financial life hack tactics you can put to good use.\n\nRemember that while these financial life hacks can be helpful, everyone’s financial situation is unique. You might consider looking at whether a particular strategy aligns with your goals, values, and circumstances before implementing it. Additionally, seeking trusted guidance when making major financial decisions can be helpful.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJulie Rogier (She/Her)\n\nWith a multi-decade career in communications, Julie Rogier serves on GreenPath’s content marketing team.

In impacted her ability to make healthy, homemade lunches for her daughter, as well as paying for the monthly YMCA membership.\n\nAlso a challenge was the growing balance on Regina’s credit card. In past years Regina had to use the card to purchase needed items for her new home, such as flooring, curtains and appliances. With the high interest rates and growing balances, she could see that getting out from under that debt would be a challenge.\n\nRegina worked with GreenPath to get on firmer financial footing. By developing a realistic plan to tackle her consumer credit card debt, Regina and the counselor considered her entire financial picture. They teamed together to not only get that high interest credit card debt in control, but to cope with the pressures of rising prices.\n\nSee Regina’s full story as told by The Detroit Free Press.\n\nFinancial Success Story 2 – An Action Plan that Works\n\nThen teenager Lavell received an unexpected piece of mail: a credit card he didn’t apply for.

My bank referred me to GreenPath and now I feel like I have a clear plan to eliminate my debt in much less time and I will save an astronomical amount on interest.”\n\n“My GreenPath counselor was extremely kind, knowledgeable, and helpful and did not pass any judgement on my situation or all of the credit card debt I have accumulated.

By following these guidelines, you can minimize the risk of falling victim to scams and protect yourself from financial harm. \n\nStay Informed\n\nRemain up to date on the latest scams and fraud techniques circulating in the financial world. Regularly check reputable sources such as official government websites, or trusted financial news outlets for updates on emerging scams.\n\nGuard Your Personal Information\n\nBe cautious about sharing sensitive personal or financial information, such as your Social Security number, bank account details, or passwords, especially over the phone or via email.

Remember the old adage: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. \n\nSecure Your Devices\n\nProtect your electronic devices, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, with up-to-date antivirus software and firewalls. Avoid accessing sensitive financial information using public Wi-Fi networks, as they may not be secure. \n\nUse Strong Passwords\n\nCreate strong, unique passwords for your online accounts and change them regularly.

We encourage you to look around our website to get a feel for all of the financial wellness resources available to you.\n\nWe’re glad you’re here and we look forward to working with you!\n\nDebt Management Plans\n\nIf you want to get out of debt and reduce financial stress, you may find debt relief through the GreenPath Debt Management Plan. If it makes sense for your situation, we will contact your creditors to propose mutually agreeable debt repayment terms. A Debt Management Plan may:\n\nStop collection calls\n\nLower interest rates\n\nLower monthly payments\n\nWaive late fees and over-limit fees\n\nA Debt Management Plan is designed to pay off the entire amount that you owe, usually within three to five years. It can help you pay off credit card debt faster, and save money on interest charges.\n\nThe first step is a free debt counseling consultation\n\nWhen you call, you’ll talk to one of our NFCC-certified credit and debt counselors.  We’ll review your financial situation together, and make a personalized plan to get your finances back on track. We’ll explain the options and give you the information you need to make a choice that works for you.\n\nCall us to get started. It’s free, confidential and no-pressure.\n\nContact Us\n\n How debt management plans work\n\nThe debt management plan consolidates your debt into a single payment. Each payday, you automatically deposit money into your GreenPath account, and we use that money to pay on your behalf. We may be able to arrange lower interest rates and monthly payments with your creditors, so you can pay off debt faster and save money. Once creditors agree to the program, collection calls stop and you see your balances start to go down.\n\nCalculate your payoff\n\nWhen you sign up for a debt management plan, you have an entire team of GreenPath people behind you. You’ll get information and support when you need it. We’re here for you at every step of the journey.\n\nYou can call us anytime during business hours to reach a debt counselor if you need advice, or to talk to your Client Success Team about your account. You also have instant access to account information through our online debt management portal.\n\nYou also have access to a community of others who are paying off their debt in a private online group. This positive community of support is a great place to ask questions, share tips, and get friendly moral support to make your journey easier.\n\nWe believe in our clients 1000%, and we love nothing more than seeing you succeed.\n\nHelp is here\n\nLast year, we helped more than 65,000 households pay off over $200 million in debt. We do this by putting people — you! — at the center of our work. Our counselors receive training in compassion and empathy. It’s our job to listen without judgment, and to treat our clients with respect.\n\nYou can request a call for a free financial counseling session to assess your situation and help you through financial decisions.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n   Which creditors do you work with?  \n\n We work with most creditors throughout the U.S., including banks, credit unions, retailers, medical providers, auto finance and collection agencies.\n\n   How much does it cost for a debt management program?  \n\n Debt Management Program set up fees and monthly fees vary based on your state of residence and debt amount. On average, GreenPath clients are charged a one-time enrollment fee of $35 and a $28 monthly fee. This is minimal considering the amount of money our clients typically save in waived late fees, waived over limit fees, and reduced credit card interest charges.\n\n   Can I still use my credit cards on a Debt Management Plan?  \n\n Since the goal of a debt management program is to pay off debt, the credit cards enroll in the program will be closed.  Most creditors will usually allow you to continue using one card for emergencies and travel.\n\n   Does GreenPath work for the banks?  \n\n GreenPath is a neutral third-party that works in your best interest.  Many creditors support our work because they believe it results in positive, long-term outcomes.\n\n   Will a Debt Management Plan hurt my credit score?  \n\n The debt management program itself is not reported to credit bureaus and does not factor into credit scores. The largest % of anyone’s credit score is payment history and with a debt management program, our goal is to make on time payments to liquidate your debt in a reasonable amount of time.  Initially, your score may dip when lines of credit are closed, however, people on a debt management program typically see their scores increase over time as they make on-time payments each month.\n\n   Are debt management plans different from debt settlement?  \n\n Yes, they are different. Debt management plans are designed to pay off the entire amount you owe in 3 to 5 years. If we can lower your interest rates, the total amount you pay to your credit card company is typically less than if you paid on your own. Debt settlement typically involves requesting credit card companies to forgive a portion of your debt in exchange for a lump sum payment."], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:43:38.787617"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2443]]

How would they describe what they want from their financial services? Would the description resemble the services they actually receive?\n\nSince 2008, the Center for Financial Inclusion at Accion has explored the customer perspective in financial inclusion by conducting research and engaging with financial service providers and their customers in dozens of countries. Through our research, we have been privileged to talk with people across the globe who are new to formal financial services, and with organizations serving them. Insights gleaned from our interactions with clients constitute a roadmap of sorts on how to “get financial inclusion right.” They point the way along the long road the sector must travel before the vision of meaningful financial inclusion is realized.\n\nAs it moves into its second decade, CFI intends to dedicate itself to search out and promote the elements of financial inclusion that bring customers what they truly need and want. With that in mind, this essay reflects on some of the findings about customers gleaned from a decade of CFI research.\n\nCustomer wishes are actually pretty simple, whether customers are poor or not and whether they live in frontier, emerging or high income markets. First, they want services that help them accomplish goals and solve problems. In the words of a customer we spoke with in Chile, “How can banks help me in my actual life?”\n\nSecond, when they use those services they want a positive experience. When consumers speak about financial service experiences, they use words like confidence, safety, trust, and understanding – or their opposite: confusion, doubt and stress. These words convey the serious emotional stakes involved in money matters. By contrast, financial service providers tend to use bloodless jargon like “addressable market”, “customer acquisition” or “user interface”. Providers must turn these business concepts into a customer experience that evokes confidence and affirmation.\n\nThis essay looks first at products that solve customer problems and then turns to the elements of a positive experience. In the first section we identify four ways to use a financial health framework to design products aimed at reaching goals and solving problems. In the section we discuss six attributes that lead to positive experiences with financial services. We conclude with a brief reflection on how financial service providers can orient themselves more broadly toward empowering customers.\n\nPart I. Financial Health\n\nIn a customer-inspired financial inclusion system, the system’s ultimate goal would be the financial health of their customers, whether they are farmers, employees, day laborers or small business owners. The Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI), which promotes the concept in the U.S., defines financial health as “day-to-day financial systems that build long-term resilience and opportunity.” We like this definition: it’s succinct and complete.\n\nWe find that people speak about financial health with similar words no matter where they live. “Financial health is when I have what I need every day.” “Financial health is when you can pay your bills and have money left over.” “Financial stability is when you don’t have to ask other people for money.” These quotes come from people in India and Kenya, and we have heard much the same from consumers in Latin America and Eastern Europe. It all comes back to three things: day-to-day financial management systems that help balance income and expenses, the ability to bounce back from the many financial shocks that beset lower income people and the ability to pursue important goals and opportunities, including those that require longer term planning and financial discipline.\n\nPeople we speak to do not just talk about financial health – they are actively striving to be financially healthy. This striving is an everyday fact of life, and it shapes the arc of families’ lives across the years. Yet, for an enormous share of the world’s people, financial health is elusive. CFSI’s research in the U.S. shows that fewer than half of Americans are financially healthy, and the Global Findex 2017 reports that about half of the people in the developing world are resilient – i.e. able to come up with the cash needed to meet a typical emergency (see page 80).\n\nIf they were to embrace financial health as an objective, financial service providers would design products aimed at supporting the elements of financial health, and would become engaged with customers as partners in their pursuit. We offer here a few thoughts on how to support financial health through financial service provision. While people can use many financial services to improve their financial health, some products or product features contribute more directly than others.\n\n1. Short-term money management products, especially if they are convenient, quick and affordable.\n\nTo assist with the day-to-day requirements of financial health, good financial services assist customers to manage their money, allow them to pay for things or send money home, help them keep track of budgets and provide access to ready money when needed. No one wants to spend time and money traveling to a bank branch and standing in line, and for many of the poor, if products cannot be accessed quickly and conveniently, and at a reasonable price, their value disappears altogether.\n\nShort-term services contribute to financial health in large part by enabling consumption smoothing, the all-important process of maintaining a steady standard of life in the face of unsteady income and expenses. Consumption smoothing is often discounted for not being as sexy as economic growth, but in fact, it is at the very center of what financial services are for. The value of getting money to the right place at the right time cannot be underestimated. Impact studies also confirm that access to mobile payments allows people to manage emergencies and broaden their business horizons.\n\nThe vast majority of the effort in financial inclusion goes to create such services, and this effort is dramatically increasing the number of users and the variety of services available. In 2017, 48 percent of the adults in the developing world had active bank accounts, and 44 percent used electronic payments, according to the Findex. Both these numbers represent substantial increases in just a few years. The momentum behind faster, cheaper banking services and payments stems in part from the competitive advantage gained by companies that create speed and convenience. We applaud the great progress that these numbers represent and the momentum that will increase them in the next decade.\n\n2. Products that support customers’ “better selves.”\n\nOne of the chief challenges consumers face in day-to-day money management is maintaining self-discipline. That’s why products to support financial health would also support customers’ “better selves”.\n\nWe heard from a hawker near a train station in India who after losing an eye – and a job – in a train accident, began placing a few rupees with a money collector at the end of every day. After several years, she had enough to purchase her own kiosk – a lifetime accomplishment that gave her enormous pride. Not everyone can be so disciplined, and if this woman had not found a trusted money collector, she might not have succeeded either. People want to build financial health, but temptation – or “life” – gets in the way.\n\nThe “nudge doctors” in behavioral economics have demonstrated biases in the way humans make decisions, many of which strongly apply to financial decisions. But customers don’t need a degree in psychology to recognize that they are liable to break their own best resolutions, make unrealistic promises, or decide to act before they have the full picture. While everyone has foibles like these, the fragile financial health of lower income people makes the consequences of poor choices that much worse. As behavioral economists have learned, products like commitment savings can help consumers maintain savings discipline, while aggressive marketing can lure them into financial decisions they later regret.\n\nDeveloping and spreading services that support self-discipline is, in my opinion, one of the most important future challenges for the financial inclusion community. Although small savings products may not be big revenue generators, they can be central to consumers’ financial health, and providers that incorporate them into their product mix may be rewarded with loyal and prospering customers.\n\n3. Products that help create resilience.\n\nChecking back with our definition of financial health, we note that unless daily systems also support resilience and opportunity, they can only be said to support financial survival, not health.\n\nGood financial services assist customers to protect themselves from the many shocks they experience, like loss of a job, a car accident or a health crisis – all of which have direct financial consequences that are especially severe for lower income people living closer to the edge. The ideal suite of products for resilience includes savings accounts for building rainy day savings, access to emergency credit, and insurance that covers a person’s most important assets – their physical health, property, and lives of family members they depend on. Today, although the numbers of people who have some form of insurance is rising fast, the value and usefulness of that coverage has a long way to go. We see a great deal of innovation in inclusive insurance, but so far that innovation remains mainly at a niche level.\n\nThis is an essential takeaway: when we talk about financial health, insurance and savings must become larger parts of the conversation.\n\n4. Products that support customers’ most cherished life goals.\n\nAs one interviewee stated, “Financial health is a house and a good salary.” The ‘big four’ lifetime goals that are often the core of a person’s financial life include: education for themselves and their children, business growth (for the self-employed), safe and comfortable shelter, and a secure old age. Good financial services can assist customers to plan for and ultimately obtain a comfortable home, their kids’ education, or security in old age – and to grow the farm or business that so many self-employed people depend on. In the past several years, with the rise of mobile payments and data analytics, we have witnessed tremendous vitality in services for small and micro enterprises. However, there is less progress in housing, education and pensions. Products addressing these latter needs are some of the most difficult products to provide, especially in emerging financial markets and for poorer people, exactly because of their long term nature.\n\nServices that support education, shelter and old age are another frontier area for the future of the financial inclusion community.\n\nPart II. Product Delivery\n\nWe turn now from financial products to their delivery and the experience that comes with using them. As we learned in our Client Voice research, the experience is often as important to customers as the product itself.\n\nCustomers new to formal financial services often approach providers hesitantly, especially if they also struggle with literacy. Interviewees often say that they feel intimidated or unwelcome when entering a bank. Such new customers may be easily turned off if their first experience leaves them feeling disrespected or confused.\n\nWith digital services, the client experience shifts in ways that can be both better and worse for the financially excluded and underserved. There is less chance of disrespect from staff, but instead, the customer faces the impenetrability of an electronic device.\n\nIn the next few paragraphs we sketch some of the most-desired attributes of the customer experience at the present moment in which the financial inclusion sector offers a mix of traditional and electronic delivery methods.\n\n5. Simple products and interactions.\n\nSimple and transparent product design enables consumers to use products appropriately and builds trust. As customer touch points shift to digital, interface designers must strive to use very simple language or images – and it helps if the products themselves are actually very simple. They should not come with hidden terms and conditions, exclusions or confusing prices. The inclusive insurance sector is finding that radical simplification of products – like doing away with costly claim verification processes – is a key to serving lower income segments, as Garance Wattez-Richard writes in her essay in this series.\n\nWe observe that many providers attempt to move towards simplicity but only get halfway there. It is easy to forget that customers may not understand ordinary banking terms, as we learned ourselves when asking people to take a financial health quiz. MicroSave, among others, has pointed out that, for people with limited literacy – or, as they call it, orality – the long number strings needed for mobile money transactions can be barriers to confidence and create errors. In Latin America, Fundación Capital found that poor women unused to ATMs were grateful to be able to practice in private on the tablet-based simulator Fundación Capital developed. We could cite many more such examples.\n\n6. The ability to talk to a person when necessary.\n\nRoutine financial service use in high income countries has become almost entirely digital; digital will soon become the norm everywhere. However, the target customers of financial inclusion are not yet prepared to live in this future.\n\nResearch by CFI Fellow Alexis Beggs-Olsen showed that after almost a decade with M-Pesa, consumers in Kenya are very comfortable conducting transactions digitally. But when they are considering whether to take up a new service, learning how a service works, and especially when something goes wrong, they would strongly prefer to talk to a person face-to-face. According to Beggs-Olsen, call centers, while they do feature human conversations, are considered – by Kenyans at least – as a poor substitute to face-to-face. Chatbots attempt to simulate human interactions, but customers still want a lifeline to a real person.\n\nIn the transition away from branch-based banking, many banks have outsourced face-to-face interactions to banking agents. However, CFI Fellows Shreya Chatterjee and Misha Sharma, who studied banking agents in India, showed that agents are not often well-trained or incentivized to fill these supportive roles.\n\nGetting the balance of tech and touch right is a significant future challenge for providers.\n\n7. Trust that providers protect them from harm and have their interests at heart.\n\nLike many useful tools, financial services can be dangerous. They need to be provided and used responsibly. As consumers begin to use new financial services, they need confidence that providers are aligned with their interests.\n\nUntil recently, consumer protections lagged under a buyer-beware philosophy that designated financial system regulation’s purview as stability. But when the 2008 financial crisis demonstrated how consumer protection failures in the U.S. mortgage market could trigger a global cascade of additional failures, regulators acknowledged that consumer protection gaps could upset stability and began to include it in their mandates. Despite a decade of effort, much remains to be done, and in many situations the incentives for providers to act responsibly need to be internally motivated – based on the business case for consumer trust.\n\nThe Smart Campaign is a global effort led by CFI to embed Client Protection Principles into the fabric of the financial inclusion sector. We have examined provider practices and heard from customers about the harms they have experienced. While much of what we have seen is not pretty – like public shaming of debt defaulters in several countries – we also know that many providers are eager to apply good practices. We have certified over 100 financial institutions for meeting such standards.\n\nDespite a decade of effort, much remains to be done, and in many situations the incentives for providers to act responsibly need to be internally motivated – based on the business case for consumer trust.\n\nThe digital revolution is creating new consumer protection challenges, which must be adequately dealt with if customers are going to fully engage with the new offerings. Concerns about legitimacy, security and the ability to fix mistakes are frequently topmost in customers’ minds. Transparency is a special challenge for mobile money and credit providers who must convey sufficient information to customers through the limited USSD. Aggressive marketing has also risen as a concern. Mobile money customers from Kenya to Peru receive loan offers, and some feel pressure to borrow, but they don’t know which companies to trust. (I also get robo-call loan offers every week. I don’t trust any of them.)\n\nWhile much research has identified consumer protection issues arising in digital financial services, there has been relatively less effort to translate that learning into standards of practice and promulgate those practices throughout the sector.\n\n8. Trust that institutions use customer assets (money and data) appropriately and safely.\n\nA special set of consumer protection concerns involves how financial institutions handle the money and data clients entrust to them. The need for assurance of the safety of deposits has been a central regulatory concern for so long that it should hardly need remarking. And yet customers are increasingly entrusting their money to new entrants, witness the P2P collapses in China, that may not have the same regulatory oversight as full-fledged banks, for example, when they store money temporarily on payment apps. So the deposit-protection concern is still with us, though in new guises.\n\nThe appropriate use of data has become a hot-button issue not only in financial services, but throughout the realms of commerce, politics and national security. In financial services, strong feelings surface on both sides. One side is enthusiastic about the opportunities opened by the mushrooming of consumer data footprints that can be analyzed with new data science techniques. The other side hoists the banner of privacy rights and asserts the need for consumer ownership and control of their own data. While many agree that consumer consent for data use is part of a solution, making consent meaningful has proved difficult. No consent often means no service. The recent promulgation in Europe of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has implications reaching all over the globe.\n\nPerhaps more than any other issue raised here, how to get to positive practices on data rights is an open question. Katharine Kemp’s essay in this series will explore the challenges in greater depth.\n\n9. Protection from frauds and scams.\n\nLow income people are continually exposed to frauds and scams. Many of these come from rogue players posing as legitimate ones. A client in Benin showed us a photograph he had taken of a storefront that opened an office in his city, collected deposits from hundreds of people, and then closed up shop. The photographer confessed that he had not known how to recognize that the business was fraudulent.  Assurance of legitimacy was a major preoccupation of the Kenyans interviewed by Beggs-Olsen about the blend of tech and touch. They relied for this assurance on the word of friends and family.\n\nWith digital services, the opportunity increases for frauds to occur inside institutions, through security breaches. CFI Fellow Patrick Traynor documented significant vulnerabilities among digital financial service apps. Given the frequency of major hacks into high-profile companies, vulnerabilities throughout the financial system are no surprise. Hackers seem always to be a few steps ahead of cybersecurity. And as Kemp argues in her forthcoming essay on data, the risk rises when more and more data is stored and moved throughout the financial sector.\n\nProviders and clients are on the same side in the effort to stop fraudsters. As the success of credit card companies over the years shows, the rewards of sustained investment in fraud control include customer loyalty, trust and usage.\n\nPart III. Considering the Customer More Broadly\n\nIf all the above conditions are met, customers would gain confidence and control in their financial lives and would relieve the stress that often accompanies the use of financial services. That in turn would promote more active use and customer loyalty.\n\nThe new players like to consider themselves as disrupters. They should also think of themselves as creators and take time to imagine the kind of financial world they want to create. How many financial institutions have taken a Hippocratic perspective and set their purpose in terms of helping their customers to achieve good financial health? A few are doing so, and we’d like to see more.\n\nTo take on an authentic consumer perspective, financial service providers would shift their mindset in important ways. They could begin by investigating the financial health of their customers (not difficult to do – see CFSI’s Financial Health Toolkit) and spending more time listening to and seeking feedback from them. CFI’s Africa Board Fellows program requires its fellows – CEOs and board directors of African financial institutions – to spend time with clients regularly. These visits have sparked important new insights, according to many of the fellows.\n\nA new mindset might also involve a more holistic view of product offerings. Initially, many fintech start-ups focus on a single product. A customer perspective would recognize how deeply interconnected financial decisions are and would seek to offer a broader range of services, thus creating deeper customer relationships. We are starting to see a welcome shift among some of the more established fintechs Accion invests in, such as Lydia and Zoona, which began with a single product and are now working to evolve a broader, more supportive product suite. Partnerships with various providers, such as those established by Dvara for its rural channels program, are another route to such an offering, which may be especially important for products like insurance and pensions.\n\nWith a new mindset, providers would also support their customers to build their financial capability – the knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to manage their financial lives well.\n\nThey would provide more support for new customers to use their products well, and would assist them in managing their financial lives and planning for their goals.\n\nEarlier we noted the language gap between customers and providers. But perhaps the gap isn’t really so large. Terms like customer segmentation, use case, and user interface are, after all, just convenient shorthand for ways of connecting with customers. Such words assist us in the technical and operational work needed to build and run an inclusive financial system. As we use them, let us always remember the fragile human hopes and dreams that are at stake, hiding beneath the jargon.\n\n\t\t\t\tElisabeth Rhyne\t\t\t\n\nFormer Managing Director\n\nFrom its founding in 2008 until retiring in 2019, Elisabeth Rhyne was the Managing Director of CFI.

This heightened awareness is unsurprising given the relentless tracking of consumers’ digital footprints, instances of data misuse by big techs and fintechs, and major security breaches such as India’s Aadhar data fiasco and the recent leak of health records of COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Data errors, biases, and privacy breaches can have grave consequences for all consumers, and particularly for low-income consumers with limited digital and financial capabilities. Data and privacy breaches can result in an increased risk of fraud, job loss, shame, and rejected loan applications or overpriced loans and other financial services, including insurance, and above all, these breaches widen the economic divide.\n\nPolicymakers increasingly recognize people’s vulnerability to data abuse and the irreparable harm that can occur in a digital and data-driven economy. In response, many countries have recently passed new data protection legislation — including China, the UAE, Brazil, Russia, Switzerland, and Rwanda — to govern the collection, use, and dissemination of personal data. As new frameworks are introduced and operationalized, it is critical for inclusive finance stakeholders to understand the perspectives of low-income consumers and their attitudes and behaviors around the use of their data.\n\nAs new frameworks are introduced and operationalized, it is critical for inclusive finance stakeholders to understand the perspectives of low-income consumers and their attitudes and behaviors around the use of their data.\n\nTo provide light on this subject, the Center for Financial Inclusion (CFI) is conducting qualitative research to better understand consumer perspectives on the uses of personal data. In 2021, CFI released research on mobile money users in Rwanda, which found that while consumers believe in the promise of digital finance, there are concerns regarding the data-related aspects of product design and the source of data collection. Following the work in Rwanda, CFI conducted focus groups in Indonesia with 50 middle- and lower-middle-income urban smartphone and digital finance app users to dig deeper into the perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors around data privacy, sharing, and other potential risks in how digital finance apps use consumers’ personal data.\n\nThe digital economy in Southeast Asia is expected to reach USD$130 billion by 2025, with Indonesia anticipated to be the largest and fastest-growing in the region. With venture capital inflows of over $1 billion, the emergence of new unicorns Xendit and Ajaib, and the growing adoption of digital payments induced by the pandemic, the digital finance ecosystem in Indonesia is projected to soar to $8.6 billion by 2025. At the same time, the rapid ascension of thousands of peer-to-peer lenders, the majority of whom are not licensed by Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority, OJK, has given rise to growing concerns regarding fraud, personal data protection policies, and awareness of consumer rights. The country is on the verge of passing its first-ever Personal Data Protection (PDP) law that introduces a data protection officer and consolidates rules related to the ownership, transfer, and processing of personal data. The PDP law emulates Europe’s Global Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) — a legal framework approved by the European Parliament that provides stringent guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals living in the European Union. To date, 16 countries across North and South America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East have implemented GDPR-like data privacy laws.\n\nCFI’s research finds that although Indonesian consumers care about and value data privacy, their attitudes and behaviors when using digital finance often do not align. Challenges in understanding complex legalese, coupled with assumptions regarding the app’s safety and other psychological and contextual factors, make it difficult for consumers, especially low-income consumers, to incorporate adequate safeguards for data privacy. CFI’s research finds:\n\nRespondents value privacy but readily share data and apps with friends and family.\n\nRespondents think apps are safe and rarely read the terms and conditions, and never in their entirety.\n\nRespondents assume apps backed by the government can be trusted.\n\nRespondents are wary of fraud but consider data misuse to be less of a threat.\n\nRespondents are unwilling to pay extra for safeguarding their data.\n\nThe results of this research point to three key takeaways for policymakers, funders, and providers in Indonesia and other emerging markets: i) make privacy the default such that privacy is integrated into the design and essential to the functionality of the app; ii) incorporate data risks in digital financial capability programs; and iii) invest in more demand-side research to inform data protection regulation.\n\n1. Respondents Value Privacy but Readily Share Data and Apps with Friends and Family\n\nWhen the focus group facilitators inquired about what constitutes private information, respondents noted that household matters such as financial or marital problems, children’s academic performance, WhatsApp messages, and photo galleries on their phones are private and should remain confidential. One respondent stated, “Privacy is keeping my data and personal information secret and confidential. Others should not know about it.” Many mentioned that violation of privacy would cause shame and embarrassment, and some feared that it could also endanger their safety. Some also worried that disclosing their misfortunes could result in other people in their community being happy about their hardships.\n\nHowever, respondents’ behavior seemed at odds with their stated desire for privacy. Most respondents were active on social media and freely shared posts about their successes, photos of their children, culinary accomplishments, and health status. While some set passwords that were difficult to guess, locked photo galleries, and even hid their salary and debt details from spouses, the majority were comfortable sharing phones, apps, and passwords with family and friends to play games or conduct ecommerce and financial transactions using their accounts. Women respondents described sharing their accounts on shopping apps such as Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia with siblings and friends, often placing orders on others’ behalf. A 41-year-old woman explained, “My sister sometimes uses my Shopee account for the verification code because her phone doesn’t support it. I am the only one with a Shopee account, so she borrows mine to make purchases.” Others mentioned that it was pragmatic to share apps given the space limitations on their phone, and most respondents had multiple social media profiles and accounts on ecommerce apps to take advantage of promotions using different email addresses.\n\nFactors such as social norms, a perceived sense of control over one’s data, and a preference for tangible, short-term benefits over potentially harmful, longer-term impacts can limit consumers’ abilities to consider privacy in digital financial services.\n\nRespondents also acknowledged that, while private, details of salary or debt amounts, Kartu Tanda Penduduk (Resident Identification Cards), Kartu Keluraga (Family Identity Cards), and land titles occasionally had to be shared to access credit. ATM PINs, while private, were occasionally shared with family and close friends to withdraw money during emergencies. Several women respondents explained that their PINs were created by family members. One woman said, “If I have to enter my PIN, I give it to my children because they are the ones who created it.” Another shared, “My husband created my PIN, so it is already being shared.”\n\nWhile, at first glance, these findings suggest that consumers may not care about privacy, studies show that several factors dictate the desire to share information with one’s networks. Factors such as social norms (the implicit and informal rules, attitudes, and behaviors that encourage consumers to follow socially accepted practices), a perceived sense of control over one’s data, and a preference for tangible, short-term benefits over potentially harmful, longer-term impacts can limit consumers’ abilities to consider privacy in digital financial services.\n\n2. Respondents Think Most Apps Are Safe and Rarely Read Terms and Conditions, and Never in Their Entirety\n\nAs part of the focus group discussions, facilitators read excerpts from WhatsApp’s terms and conditions to gauge respondents’ familiarity with the language and the concept of terms and conditions in general. While most participants in the focus group discussions acknowledged seeing the clauses when installing the app, no one had fully read them. Respondents explained that the text of the terms and conditions was too long, overly complex, and difficult to understand. Older respondents struggled with the font size. The majority reported that they usually skipped the terms and conditions while downloading an app and scrolled directly to the “I agree” section. Some also said they skimmed through the text and read what was “necessary” and highlighted in bold font. If confused by the language, some respondents said they turned to their children for guidance, who advised them to skip the text and not share account details with others as a precautionary measure. Women respondents sometimes turned to their husbands for permission or children for guidance when downloading finance apps.\n\nMore fundamentally, there was a wide variance in respondents’ understanding of what the terms and conditions represented. Focus group respondents provided myriad interpretations regarding what they thought was the purpose of the terms and conditions in digital finance and other apps. Some respondents believed that the terms and conditions clarified an app’s functionality. Others were of the opinion that the terms explained how apps prevented data theft by tracking criminals and blocking miscreants. A few respondents also thought the terms existed to reassure and convince users that the apps were safe.\n\nNotably, several respondents assumed that the terms and conditions were the same across all apps, and therefore, there was no need to read them every time they downloaded a new app. Some also pointed to the power and information asymmetries between app providers and consumers, and how their options were limited if they had concerns about the terms. One respondent stated, “We can read it in detail, but we have to go back [and cancel the download] if we don’t agree with the terms.”\n\n3. Respondents Assume Apps Backed by the Government Can Be Trusted\n\nBecause of the complexities of the terms and conditions, respondents often turned to others for cues, and the more widely used an app is, the more it is considered trustworthy and safe. As one respondent stated, “If everyone is doing it, it must be safe.” Respondents assumed that apps like WhatsApp were legitimate because Indonesia’s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Kominfo, had authorized its use. They also cited the clampdown on some illegal apps as examples of the government’s efforts to protect users. Similarly, respondents considered digital finance apps such as Kredivo and Home Credit to be trustworthy because they were licensed by OJK, Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority. One respondent expressed, “If a lending app [from a bank] is registered with OJK, we have protection. Otherwise, it is not safe and can’t be trusted.”\n\nPeople often exhibit an illusory sense of control over their data, struggling to understand the true implications of how their information is used in the complex data ecosystem.\n\nCFI’s findings resonate with Acquisti et al.’s research that people have limited attention spans and often exhibit an illusory sense of control over their data, struggling to understand the true implications of how their information is used in the complex data ecosystem. Consequently, they tend to trust the actions of their peer group. This dilemma holds in both developed and developing countries. Hartzog and others have estimated that the typical internet user would need 76 working days to read all the privacy policies they encounter in the course of one year. This “bandwidth problem” is exacerbated for low-income consumers and women, in particular, who have a limited understanding of the complex digital ecosystem.\n\n4. Respondents Are Wary of Fraud but Consider Data Misuse To Be Less of a Threat\n\nWhile nearly all focus group participants were sensitive to tangible risks such as fraud, cybercrimes, and the usurious lending practices of online lenders, respondents were less concerned about data misuse or informational errors. Respondents shared instances of acquaintances fraudulently using their information to obtain loans, ecommerce accounts being hacked, or suspicious phone calls asking for their PIN. Given these apprehensions, respondents were careful about downloading apps that were rumored to be unsafe. One respondent explained, “There was viral news about a Zoom data leak, so I was afraid to download it. I avoided using Zoom until recently. But, ultimately, I was forced to register because I needed the app.”\n\nRespondents had not considered the possibility of app developers gaining access to their personal data to be a potential threat. In general, respondents believed that the apps were tracking their data to prevent its misuse, to understand customer behavior, and to provide tailored product recommendations. Respondents hoped their data would not be sold to third parties, and the consensus was that “even if apps sell our data, they may have their reasons, but it’s nothing to worry about.” This presumption was particularly true for global apps, such as WhatsApp, as respondents believed they could report issues directly to WhatsApp or escalate it to the country’s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology for proper resolution.\n\nAfter probing, respondents conceded that it was likely that apps could access their photo gallery, messages, emails, contact lists, call data records, phone usage patterns, as well as IDs and any documents lending apps had collected. Until the focus group facilitators raised the concern, however, most respondents had never considered the possibility that in consenting to a service, they could be signing away their data rights and providing firms with blanket permission to use and sell their information. During the discussions, some respondents wondered if they were putting themselves at greater risk by using their social media accounts to log in to other apps. A few respondents assumed that in the worst case, they could simply delete the apps to keep their data safe.\n\n5. Respondents Are Unwilling to Pay Extra for Safeguarding Their Data\n\nTo better understand how consumers value privacy, we asked respondents if they would pay more for a digital finance app that does not share their data. Given that most focus group respondents did not consider the risks arising from the sale and misuse of personal data, they were unwilling to pay extra for safeguarding their data. Respondents would only consider paying for an app if there was no free alternative available.\n\nRespondents stated they should not have to pay for apps since the provider was benefiting from consumers using the app. Furthermore, they believed that they were indirectly paying for the app by being forced to view ads. Participants also voiced doubts about whether their data would be more secure if they paid for it. As stated by one of the men interviewed, “We have to be smart. We can’t easily trust anybody if it relates to our privacy.”\n\nWhen given a tradeoff between price and privacy, customers almost always resort to the cheapest, less-private option.\n\nThese findings contrast insights from experiments conducted by CGAP in Kenya and India, which suggest that low-income consumers may be willing to pay more and spend more time obtaining a loan that offers greater privacy and protection. While more research is needed to understand these differences, it is important to recognize that, unlike the context of the CGAP research, CFI did not conduct a controlled experiment whereby participants are offered multiple options with different prices and privacy levels. Instead, through focus group discussions, we asked people about the notion of privacy and to what extent they would go to protect their data. CFI’s research findings align with several other studies that show that when given a tradeoff between price and privacy, customers almost always resort to the cheapest, less-private option, or they opt to part with their data in exchange for free pizza slices or other small, tangible rewards. Furthermore, for many respondents, the immediate convenience offered by social media logins triumphed over the longer-term, intangible risk of data misuse by app providers and third parties.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWhile policymakers and technology providers advocate for increased transparency, hoping that people will have sufficient understanding to self-regulate their data and provide informed consent, growing evidence suggests that privacy perceptions are highly subjective and, therefore, can be easily influenced by app providers. At the same time, people face numerous barriers in navigating the many apps that access their data and must constantly manage what information can be disclosed and what should be withheld to protect their privacy. Findings from CFI’s focus groups with middle- and lower-middle-income urban digital users in Indonesia show that despite being digitally active, people are ill-equipped to self-govern in a fast-moving data ecosystem. This issue is likely to be far worse for lower-income populations.\n\nOur research highlights three areas that policymakers, funders, and providers in Indonesia and other emerging markets should consider as they work to create a safe and robust data ecosystem for inclusive finance consumers:\n\n1. Make privacy the default.\n\nAs Indonesian policymakers and other stakeholders are strengthening the pending PDP law, CFI encourages the government to consider these findings and make privacy the default, integrating privacy measures directly into the design of the app. Low-income consumers often lack the baseline knowledge and capability to interpret complex legalese or understand how their mouse clicks and web activities are tracked. Consequently, policymakers need to incentivize providers to develop solutions where consumers are not required to self-regulate their data. Instead, privacy should be a forethought, embedded throughout the design and engineering processes, as laid out in Article 25 of the Global Data Privacy Regulations.\n\n2. Include data risks in digital financial capability initiatives.\n\nAt CFI, we define digital financial capability as the ability to access, manage, understand, integrate, and evaluate financial services offered through digital technologies. As the line between inclusive and digital finance is increasingly blurred, it is evident that digital and financial capability-building initiatives must go beyond financial and digital literacy and include components that help consumers understand and respond to data risks.\n\nOne of the most obvious reasons why, despite best intentions, consumers fail to consider privacy is a general lack of awareness about what data is collected and how it is disseminated and used. In this complex data ecosystem, the odds are stacked against low-income users with limited digital capabilities. For people to better protect their privacy and data, information needs to be available and presented in a way that is easily comprehended so consumers can be informed when using digital finance and other apps.\n\n3. Invest in demand-side research across different contexts.\n\nData privacy is a complex issue. Unfortunately, research on understanding consumer perspectives — a crucial step to addressing these issues — is scant. CFI’s research contributes to insights on how people’s attitudes, perceptions, and social norms are evolving in this rapidly changing environment. Much more research — combining psychology, economics, computer science, and law — is needed to better understand how consumers engage with the data ecosystem and the costs, benefits, and potential long-term ramifications of different policy interventions that help consumers consider privacy.\n\nAbout This Study\n\nThe author would like to thank the lead researcher Alex Rizzi, as well as Julia Arnold for supporting the research and Aeriel Emig for her editorial oversight.\n\nThrough this research, CFI aims to test different research methodologies to determine what approaches can help elicit information from consumers on frontier topics. Previous research in Rwanda indicates that more open-ended and interactive approaches such as focus groups were best suited for nuanced discussions on complex, new concepts. To that end, this study involved a series of focus group discussions with 50 male and female urban smartphone users. Respondents were selected from Indonesia’s Financial Inclusion Insights Survey (FII) by the National Council for Financial Inclusion (Dewan Nasional Keuangan Inklusif – DNKI). The interview guide was designed by the Center for Financial Inclusion (CFI) and administered by Kantar, a global data research, insights, and consulting company. There were ten focus group discussions divided into six female and four male groups. Each group had five to eight participants from Jakarta, Java, Sulawesi, and Sumatra.\n\nThe goal of this research was to explore the opinions and attitudes of a small group of urban digital consumers and as such, caution should be used in interpreting the results as the study was not designed to be widely generalized.\n\nAuthors\n\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n\t\t\t\tAnindita Chakraborty\t\t\t\n\nSenior Manager, Special Projects and Operations\n\nAnindita is an inclusive finance specialist with eleven years of experience undertaking research, ratings, client protection certifications, program implementation, training, and evaluation across multiple countries in Asia and Africa. She works closely with CFI’s Managing Director and leadership team on fundraising, operationalizing CFI’s strategy, internal knowledge management, and organizational processes.\n\nBefore joining CFI in October 2020, Anindita worked as an evidence and insights fellow at the UN Foundation’s Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL), where she helped develop a category management guide to enable developing country governments to strategically procure digital technologies. Anindita has worked for several financial inclusion organizations, including Dvara Finance, M-CRIL LLP, and Entrepreneurial Finance Lab (now LenddoEFL).

One of CFI’s long-standing strategic priorities has been to help build trust in digital finance for low-income consumers, in part by bringing transparency and accountability to how providers use customer data. This Data Privacy Day, CFI is excited to share a concrete tool for fintechs and digital FSPs — Privacy as Product Playbook — to embed data privacy from the outset to better protect consumers. This article discusses why the playbook addresses broader industry needs to embed responsible product design and how it was crafted.  \n\nFor years, we have been discussing how the digitalization of financial services is transforming the customer experience, and with it the meaning of responsible practice. In 2019, Elisabeth Rhyne, former Managing Director of CFI, wrote that with the shift from fully in-person interactions to digital ones, “the problem of rogue or substandard staff behavior disappears […] But so does the helpful staff person who can answer a client’s questions and guide the client to the right product. With digital services, everything the client experiences is pre-programmed and embedded into the user interface upfront before a single client has clicked on a single screen.” The implication was clear: good practice for inclusive finance was going to depend increasingly on responsible design.  \n\nThe digitalization of financial services has brought in legions of talented technologists — data scientists, UX/UI designers, engineers, and product managers — whose decisions significantly impact the experiences of low-income and vulnerable financial consumers. Like loan officers and front-line staff in traditional business models, these individuals and teams are making decisions that lead either to a delightful user experience or a disastrous one (see the edtech Byju in India). And at the same time, these technologists — some new to working in inclusive finance — may not be fully aware of the specific needs of low-income consumers, how design decisions can impact those consumers, or how to build consumers’ trust in digital finance.  \n\nWithin inclusive financial services, data collection and processing occur under the radar of most consumers, and research suggests that achieving truly informed consent is often untenable. \n\nWe know that for the 1.4 billion people currently outside the formal financial system, lack of trust is a major reason why unbanked adults do not use formal financial services. As part of CFI’s workstream on responsible data practices, we are tackling a particularly thorny area in building trust with consumers: privacy. Within inclusive financial services, data collection and processing occur under the radar of most consumers, and research suggests that achieving truly informed consent is often untenable. Unfortunately, privacy-related harms have become all-too-common, with examples of mishandled data and outright sexual harassment, including fake graphics used to intimidate female digital borrowers . These types of incidents only further deplete trust in digital finance.  \n\nAt CFI, we are focusing on a “by-design” philosophy across our thematic areas of research. Privacy by Design (PbD) specifically aims to enhance how privacy is integrated into systems and provides an alternative to the prevalent compliance-centric approaches to managing privacy issues. By emphasizing privacy in the initial design of digital products, privacy is transformed into a core aspect of a system rather than serving as a checkbox for regulatory compliance, as it is often the case with legislation such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  \n\nCFI conducted a literature review in 2022 that found support for Privacy by Design across disciplines including computer science, engineering, UX/UI and academia but resulted in few concrete and successful case studies. To date, PbD has occupied a liminal space — where theoretical and conceptual support is strong, but there are limited examples of how private sector companies have practically put PbD into practice. And there are not yet any examples of PbD being used in the inclusive finance sector.  \n\nLeveraging by-design thinking, we created the Privacy as Product Playbook, a first-of-its-kind knowledge product for the inclusive finance sector that outlines how to integrate responsible data practices and privacy into the design of digital financial products geared for low-income users. The principle is simple: when privacy needs are considered from the beginning of the design process, there are positive benefits for both the business and the consumer — it can streamline design processes and eliminate costs of retooling, and it takes consumer needs and protection into account while ultimately builds consumer loyalty. However, in practice, implementing a PbD approach can take time and effort and requires the support of both product managers and leadership teams.  \n\nOur hope is that the Privacy as Product Playbook will spur inclusive finance product designers and leaders to adopt PbD thinking in their work. The playbook offers a clear guide for product management teams at digital finance companies. As mentioned earlier, a new generation of technologists is crafting the customer experience — for better or worse — and product managers have pivotal influence on these technologists. Product managers must strike a balance between creating value for both consumers and the business, which entails not only meeting users’ needs but also ensuring a viable path to commercialization.  \n\nTo make the introduction of PbD as approachable as possible, the playbook includes a step-by-step guide on how to include PbD throughout the product development lifecycle, interactive worksheets for teams to implement PbD in their work, practical tips on championing PbD within a company, and common privacy traps to avoid. It emphasizes the importance of crafting a responsible data strategy specifically for the development of new digital financial products and of prioritizing the privacy needs of end users in every important decision. The playbook aims to show that privacy can provide crucial benefits to companies and should be seen as a value-add rather than as a compliance cost.  \n\nThis playbook represents what we believe is an important thread for the future of responsible finance, where in the throes of digitalization, good practices increasingly hinge on good design. Beyond the PbD playbook, our consumer protection workstream has explored deceptive design tactics that impair consumer autonomy. We are currently conducting an experiment on the impacts of positive friction in digital lending, which involves introducing friction thoughtfully at key decision points in the loan application process to enable suitable and intentional loan selection and usage by consumers.  \n\nSo this year, as we celebrate Data Privacy Day, we encourage the inclusive finance community to embrace the importance of responsible design and how it can lead to significant improvements in consumer trust in digital financial services.  \n\nThe PbD playbook and accompanying brief were a result of CFI’s partnership with PayPal’s Global Privacy Team.\n\nAuthors\n\n\t\t\t\tAlex Rizzi\t\t\t\n\nFormer Senior Research Director, Consumer Data Opportunities and Risks\n\nDuring her time at CFI from 2012-2024, Alex was an advocate for consumer protection and evidence-based inclusive finance practices.\n\nShe managed the responsible data practices research portfolio at CFI which focuses on opportunities and risks for low-income consumers from data-driven financial services.

Based on insights gained from a series of interviews with providers and other market players, we introduce a framework of these strategies and explore the barriers and challenges in the data economy, while identifying a series of recommendations for key stakeholders to develop a more effective data ecosystem.\n\nAccess to reliable and comprehensive data is fundamental to achieving financial inclusion, as it enables financial institutions to assess creditworthiness, tailor financial products, and extend services to underserved populations. In Egypt — which has a large informal economy, high mobile connectivity, and significant venture capital investment — fintechs are targeting either data scarcity or data dormancy to produce data trails for consumers operating outside the digital economy. Despite these innovative efforts, fintechs face numerous barriers, including regulatory hurdles, the absence of robust data exchange infrastructure, and inadequate data strategies that tend to over-collect data without a purpose. In order to sufficiently address these barriers to create data trails, the authors of this report provide specific recommendations for policymakers and regulators, industry associations, investors, and fintechs and digital platforms to act in a coordinated effort to extend financial services to underserved populations in Egypt.\n\nCFI completed this work as part of our partnership with FMO, the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank to advance responsible digital finance. We would like to acknowledge the support provided by MASSIF, the financial inclusion fund that FMO manages on behalf of the Dutch government.\n\nAuthors\n\n\t\t\t\tColin Rice\t\t\t\n\nSenior Research Specialist\n\nColin joins CFI as a research specialist with a background in project design, monitoring and evaluation, and social performance management.

Since the launch of the Pix payment system in 2020, over 140 million Brazilians – approximately 80 percent of the adult population – have sent or received an electronic payments transfer. And while there are still vast social and economic inequities, and rising loan defaults that need safeguards to protect vulnerable consumers, there are also innovations in how financial services and products are delivered to address these inequities, often at the most local level.\n\nBanco Palmas as a community bank\n\nIn Fortaleza, I saw an example of local innovation when visiting Banco Palmas. I was given a debit card made of bamboo, the local Palmas plant, pre-loaded with 50 Brazilian reais. The card was usable at local merchant points and served as a reminder of Brazil’s position at the frontier of climate change. For the consumers we visited, however, it was more practical: their first point of contact with a digital financial system.\n\nBanco Palmas, one of Brazil’s first community development banks, was founded in 1998 as part of the ‘solidarity finance’ movement. It is a fascinating organization that reflects Brazil’s financial inclusion journey. Emerging from a need to address social inequities, the model has been enabled by the country’s digital transformation and is embedded deeply in the economic as well as the social fabric of the community.\n\nLike many of Brazil’s large cities, Fortaleza houses a significant percentage of its population in favelas. Conjunto Palmeira, where Banco Palmas is located, is a neighborhood occupied by a community that had been displaced from the coasts to a flooded, swamp-filled region. By the 1990s, the urbanization of Fortaleza meant that Conjunto Palmeira received access to a sewage and drainage system, drinking water, and electricity. However, the area still lacked access to formal financial services and employment, and literacy was limited.\n\nLong before financial diaries became popular in the inclusive finance sector as a method to understand financial lives, Banco Palmas’ founder Joaquim Melo and his team utilized a participatory approach to identify community needs. They interviewed 2,300 of the 18,000 residents of Conjunto Palmeira to map their financial lives, and using these insights, they created a community bank built around a local ‘currency’ – an e-money that could be used locally initially, and later became interoperable with the Brazilian reais. At the same time, they used their learnings to create an ecosystem of solutions with connections to the real economy, by organizing around producer cooperatives and bringing economic development and jobs to local neighborhoods by encouraging consumption of local products.\n\nToday, Banco Palmas is part of a larger network of over 100 community banks, all grounded in the linkage between the financial and real economies and catering to some of the most vulnerable communities in Brazil: indigenous communities, fisherfolk in the Amazon, smallholder farmers, and residents of favelas across the country.\n\nThe beauty of the Banco Palmas model is that it began with consumer needs and responded with a financial service to meet those needs, but it didn’t end there. Banco Palmas also systematically continued to track the marketplace and its producer-consumer dynamics; in doing so, the institution channeled capital to places that most needed it, creating a strategic ‘moat’ for the model and resilience for the community.\n\nThis is embedded finance at its best, where community members can use financial services that are embedded within the real economy and, in turn, strengthen the real economy. The model continues to evolve to adapt to opportunities in the external environment and benefit from these linkages.\n\nLessons from Banco Palmas\n\nThere are three lessons I gleaned from Banco Palmas, which are relevant to the larger story of embedded financial services for inclusion and impact.\n\n1. Develop solutions in a participatory manner\n\nFirst, institutions that cater to the needs of consumers at the last mile often speak of consumer insights. However, few institutions truly involve consumers in a participatory manner, by listening and learning, to first identify the explicit needs of those customers to participate in the formal economy, but also continuously learn from their experiences and understand the more implicit needs of the community to grow local businesses and build community cohesion.\n\nParticipatory problem solving was at the heart of Banco Palmas from the beginning of its journey, which both allowed them to meet the community’s needs, but this approach also created buy-in for the products and services they offered to meet those needs. Financial products can be stressful for new users, and Banco Palmas’ approach helped mitigate this challenge.\n\n2. Move beyond income and expenses at household level to enable wealth creation at community level\n\nOver the years, Banco Palmas has not only been extending credit to the local community, they have also been building on the initial learnings by systematically tracking shifts in local demand and consumption. The Banco Palmas enterprise offices reminded me of FarmVille, filled with hand-drawn charts that track data on demand and supply of milk, eggs, and other agricultural and consumer products from the community, to understand wealth generated within the community from local employment and sales of products, and surplus sold outside the community.\n\nBut this is not a game. This is a data-driven and analytical way to really understand the supply and demand dynamics of the community. And critically, enterprises are started and funded based on insights from this consumer demand data to inform what can be produced locally, allowing local entrepreneurs to both sustainable businesses and generate jobs for the community.\n\n3. Finance to improve living conditions, but also to strengthen the social fabric of local communities\n\nDuring the extended lockdown period catalyzed by the COVID pandemic, Banco Palmas realized that the local community faced food insecurity. Given the lack of space and irrigation facilities available to grow vegetables in the Conjunto Palmeira neighborhood, Banco Palmas trained people to grow vertical hydroponic gardens. A few years later, the produce from the gardens is not just used for consumption by local families, the surplus is used in other training programs the community runs like the Ceara Cuisine Festival that trains beneficiaries of the Bolsa Familia programs to display their culinary skills.\n\nThe skill-building programs extend beyond growing food to tailoring, and even nurturing artistic talent. A particularly inspiring example we saw was the ‘white hands’ choir, deaf singers who use Brazilian sign language to find dignity and voice through their art. In the Conjunto Palmeira community, finance is not just a tool to improve living conditions, but also build a supporting environment for vulnerable communities.  \n\nScaling socially embedded financial solutions\n\nWith last week’s announcement at the G20 meetings in Rio that South Africa would assume the G20 presidency next, I started reflecting on the path forward, and thinking about the innovations that we will learn from, as we spend time there next year.\n\nBanco Palmas uniquely builds on Brazil’s digital transformation, and the bamboo card reminds me that digital transformation ultimately comes from establishing strong use cases that serve the local market.\n\nThe model exists in over 100 communities and community banks across Brazil as an example of ‘scale through replication.’ However, each of these community banks has repositories of rich data about local communities. Could this data be used to design and deliver innovative and responsible services if it were made available more widely? And is there sufficient sharing across institutions, both within Brazil but also with institutions in other countries (like South Africa and others) that might face similar economic conditions? And what can Brazil continue to learn from innovations in other parts of the world?\n\nOne theme is universal, however. Rising inequality can destroy social cohesion and trust. Financial services that seek to build social cohesion can be an important response to broader development problems and, in turn, contribute to social capital and community resilience. Banco Palmas has built an institution that has strengthened the local community financially but also created the broader change they wanted to see, which is perhaps the most valuable lesson of all.\n\nAuthors\n\n\t\t\t\tKarthik Venkataraman\t\t\t\n\nChief Operating Officer, Accion\n\nKarthik joins Accion International from Bain &amp; Company, where he and the Bain team have partnered with Accion across strategy and a range of other topics since 2015.

These companion reports analyze the current state of data exchange in four leading markets — Brazil, the EU, India, and Singapore — highlighting their innovative approaches and the practical challenges they face during implementation. While there are many opportunities, the key barriers to data exchange include incentivizing incumbent banks, fostering a competitive ecosystem for third-party providers, ensuring interoperability, preventing data silos, and building trust through transparency and robust governance.\n\nThe main report offers the unique realities of implementing data exchange practices after the first few years and the barriers and opportunities that arise therein. By focusing on real-world applications and policy choices, this report provides practical examples and emerging approaches to overcoming implementation challenges in data exchange frameworks. The accompanying report on market deep dives is a companion reading which provides more detailed case studies from Brazil, the EU, India, and Singapore that highlight diverse approaches to financial inclusion, data sharing, and protection policies, offering insights for emerging and developing economies. It reviews new and alternative data sharing arrangements, moving beyond traditional credit reporting to explore multilateral, government-led, market-led, and decentralized ecosystems aimed at broadening data access and usage.\n\nThe authors extend their sincere gratitude to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for their generous support of this project. We are particularly thankful to Ariadne Plaitakis and Hillary Miller-Wise for their invaluable guidance throughout the process.\n\nAuthors\n\n\t\t\t\tEdoardo Totolo\t\t\t\n\nVice President, Research and Programs\n\nEdoardo joined CFI in 2022 as Vice President of Research and Programs, where he oversees CFI’s thought leadership in the thematic areas of financial consumer protection, responsible data practices, and green inclusive finance.\n\nPrior to joining CFI, Edoardo worked for IFC’s venture capital team in Washington, D.C., where he promoted enabling environments and investment opportunities in embedded finance, startup ecosystems, and the digital economy.

It is an honor to be here with Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who pioneered the original Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy in 2012. It is a pleasure to discuss the new statement, unanimously approved by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last week.1 By bringing our longer-run goals and strategy into alignment with key longer-run changes in the economy, the new statement will strengthen our support for the recovery. In my view, the new statement breaks important ground and will serve the country well as we respond to the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nKey Longer-Run Changes in the Economy\n\nThree related features of the economy's new normal called for the reassessment of the Committee's longer-run goals and strategy.2 First, the equilibrium interest rate has fallen to low levels, which implies a large decline in how much we can cut interest rates to support the economy. 3 That was abundantly clear in March, when we were able to cut the policy rate by only 1-1/2 percentage points before hitting the effective lower bound—in contrast to previous decades when the policy rate would have been cut by 4-1/2 to 5 percentage points, on average, to buffer the economy from an adverse shock. The reduced scope to cut the interest rate could increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is pinned close to zero, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target. In turn, the greater likelihood of extended periods of low inflation at the lower bound risks eroding inflation expectations and further compressing the scope for cutting the interest rate. The risk here is a downward spiral where the scope for cutting the interest rate gets compressed even further, the lower bound binds even more frequently, and it becomes increasingly difficult to move inflation expectations and inflation back up to target. The experience of some foreign central banks illustrates the challenges associated with such a downward spiral.\n\nSecond, underlying trend inflation appears to be somewhat below the Committee's 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters.4 The near decade of inflation persistently short of 2 percent creates the risk that households and businesses come to expect inflation to run persistently below target and change their behavior in a way that fulfills that expectation, which greatly complicates the task of monetary policy. While inflation expectations are difficult to measure with precision, some market-based and survey-based indicators show signs of a downward drift. Ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations are well-anchored at 2 percent is critical to achieving target inflation.\n\nFinally, the sensitivity of price inflation to labor market tightness is very low relative to earlier decades, which is what economists mean when they say that the Phillips curve is flat.5 A flat Phillips curve has the important advantage of allowing employment to continue expanding for longer without generating inflationary pressures, thereby providing job opportunities to people that might not otherwise have them. It also means that it is harder to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis when inflation expectations have drifted below 2 percent.\n\nKey Changes in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Strategy\n\nThe new statement on goals and strategy responds to these features of the new normal in a compelling and pragmatic way by making four important changes. First, the statement defines the statutory maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal and eliminates the reference to a numerical estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.6 The longstanding presumption that accommodation should be reduced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears the neutral rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize risks an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many Americans. The decision to allow the labor market to continue healing after the unemployment rate effectively reached the 5 percent median Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) estimate of the normal unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 supported a further decrease of 3-1/2 percentage points in the Black unemployment rate and of 2-1/4 percentage points in the Hispanic unemployment rate, as well as an increase of nearly 3 percentage points in the labor force participation rate of prime-age women. It also created conditions for the entry of a further 3-1/2 million prime-age Americans into the labor force, a movement of nearly 1 million people out of long-term unemployment, and opportunities for 2 million involuntary part-time workers to secure full-time jobs.7 Beyond that, had the changes to monetary policy goals and strategy we made in the new statement been in place several years ago, it is likely that accommodation would have been withdrawn later, and the gains would have been greater.\n\nInstead of an aggregate &quot;normal&quot; unemployment rate, the Committee's commitment to defining the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal, together with our continued commitment to consider a wide range of indicators, may be particularly significant for the groups that are most vulnerable to employment fluctuations.8 Both research and experience suggest the groups that face the greatest structural challenges in the labor market are likely to be the first to experience layoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during recoveries. Research by the Federal Reserve Board staff finds that unemployment rates, as well as patterns of job loss and labor force entry and exit, are more cyclically sensitive for Blacks and Hispanics than for whites, and observable worker characteristics can explain very little of these differentials.9 A similar observation was one of the key takeaways from the Fed Listens sessions we held around the country.10 Juan Salgado, chancellor of the City Colleges of Chicago, described how last year's tight labor market was finally giving his students, who are largely Black and Latinx, the opportunity to apprentice with local businesses in jobs that historically have not been open to them.11 Moreover, earnings from wages are particularly important for these groups, who have large and persistent wealth gaps and derive a smaller share of their income from financial asset holdings or from business ownership.12\n\nSecond, to address the downward bias to inflation associated with the proximity to the effective lower bound, the statement adopts a flexible inflation averaging strategy that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time in order to ensure longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent. Flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT) is a consequential change in strategy. By committing to seek inflation that averages 2 percent over time, FAIT means that appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for a time to compensate for a period, such as the present, when it has been persistently below 2 percent.13 Consistent with this, I would expect the Committee to accommodate rather than offset inflationary pressures moderately above 2 percent, in a process of opportunistic reflation.\n\nFlexible average inflation targeting is a pragmatic way to implement a makeup strategy, which is essential to arrest any downward drift in inflation expectations.14 While a formal average inflation target (AIT) rule is appealing in theory, there are likely to be communications and implementation challenges in practice related to time-consistency and the mechanical nature of such rules. Analysis suggests it could take many years with a formal AIT rule to return the price level to target following a lower-bound episode, and a mechanical AIT rule is likely to become increasingly difficult to explain and implement as conditions change over time.15 In contrast, FAIT is better suited for the highly uncertain and dynamic context in which policymaking takes place.\n\nIn my mind, the commitment to undertake a review of the new strategy and goals in roughly five years is a necessary complement to the flexibility embedded in the new inflation averaging strategy. Since the Committee is adopting a new approach, it is prudent and pragmatic to review it after gaining some practical experience with it over five years. As such, the five-year review will provide a vital checkpoint to see how well flexible average inflation targeting is working and, in my thinking, provide some insights into an appropriate makeup period. Depending on conditions at the time of the review, the Committee will have the opportunity to tweak FAIT or to make a more fundamental change, if deemed necessary.\n\nThird, the statement highlights an important change in the Committee's reaction function. Whereas previously it sought to mitigate deviations of employment and inflation from their targets in either direction, the Committee will now seek &quot;to mitigate shortfalls of employment from the Committee's assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal.&quot; This change implies that the Committee effectively will set monetary policy to minimize the welfare costs of shortfalls of employment from its maximum and not preemptively withdraw support based on a historically steeper Phillips curve that is not currently in evidence and inflation that is correspondingly much less likely to materialize.16 Consistent with this, the statement drops language about a &quot;balanced approach&quot; that might be interpreted as calling for the preemptive withdrawal of accommodation and replaces it with a more accurate description of how we pursue our dual-mandate goals in parallel.\n\nFourth and finally, the statement codifies the key lesson from the Global Financial Crisis—that financial stability is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. The same changes in the macroeconomic environment that prompted our monetary policy review have important implications for financial stability. Historically, when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up. The rise in inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to restrictive levels, which would have the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly. In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.\n\nWith a flat Phillips curve and low inflation, the Committee would have to sustain the federal funds rate below the neutral rate for much longer in order to push inflation back to target sustainably. The resulting expectation of lower-for-longer interest rates, along with sustained high rates of resource utilization, is conducive to increasing risk appetite, reach-for-yield behavior, and incentives for leverage—which can boost financial imbalances as an expansion extends. In this way, the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation can lead to more cyclical volatility in asset prices. With financial stability risks more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is vital to use macroprudential as well as standard prudential tools as the first line of defense in order to allow monetary policy to remain focused on achieving maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation.17\n\nSupporting the Recovery\n\nThe Committee's new statement on goals and strategy will put us in a stronger position to support a full and timely recovery in employment and average inflation of 2 percent. Overall financial conditions are supportive. Encouragingly, the housing sector has rebounded strongly from its initial decline, supported by historically low mortgage rates, and consumer spending on goods has held up well, in part reflecting earlier fiscal support.18 At the same time, however, the strong pace of improvement in employment in May and June, which was importantly driven by recall hiring out of temporary layoffs, appears to have slowed.19 And on the inflation front, despite some bounceback in July, inflation remains weaker than pre-crisis, and it is likely to take some time to return closer to target.20\n\nLooking ahead, the economy continues to face considerable uncertainty associated with the vagaries of the COVID-19 pandemic, and risks are tilted to the downside. The longer COVID-19-related uncertainty persists, the greater the risk of shuttered businesses and permanent layoffs in some sectors. While the virus remains the most important factor, the magnitude and timing of further fiscal support is a key factor for the outlook. As was true in the first phase of the crisis, fiscal support will remain essential to sustaining many families and businesses.\n\nWith the recovery likely to face COVID-19-related headwinds for some time, in coming months, it will be important for monetary policy to pivot from stabilization to accommodation. As we move to the next phase of monetary policy, we will be guided by the Committee's new goals and strategy statement. It will be important to provide the requisite accommodation to achieve maximum employment and average inflation of 2 percent over time, following persistent underperformance. While the Committee did not anticipate the unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic when the review was launched, the new statement puts us in a stronger position to support a full and timely recovery.21\n\n1.

In contrast, at the aggregate level, inflation that is too low can make it very challenging for monetary policy to cut the short-term interest rate sufficiently to support the economy effectively in a downturn.

Yellen. “The investments in the President’s budget are fully paid for, and the budget would reduce deficits by approximately $3 trillion through a combination of smart savings and tax proposals that ensure wealthy individuals and large corporations pay their fair share.”  \n\nUnder President Biden, the United States has experienced historic economic progress. Thanks to President Biden’s policies, the U.S. saw the fastest, most equitable economic recovery in its history. The President’s long-term strategies have since sustained an unemployment rate below 4% for more than two years, the longest stretch in more than 50 years, increased real wages for Americans to above pre-pandemic levels, reduced inflation by more than 2/3 from its peak, and led to robust GDP growth which has blown past expectations. \n\nThe President’s FY25 budget will build on this momentum by continuing to lower costs for working families, investing in America and the American people, protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and further reducing the deficit by cracking down on tax evasion by the wealthy, cutting wasteful spending, and making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. \n\nThe Administration’s revenue proposals would ensure that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share and, in doing so, fully pay for the investments proposed in the President’s Budget while generating roughly $3 trillion in additional deficit reduction over the next decade. The proposals would also lower costs by expanding key tax credits for workers and families.\n\nKey revenue proposals in the Greenbook would:\n\nEnsure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, by:\n\nImplementing a global minimum tax that will strengthen the taxation of corporations’ foreign income by ensuring that all multinationals pay at least a 21% minimum rate on their earnings in each jurisdiction, thereby stopping the race to the bottom on corporate tax rates and leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses.\n\nIncreasing the corporate minimum tax rate to 21% to align with the global minimum tax rate.\n\nImplementing a Billionaire Minimum Tax of 25% on the wealthiest taxpayers to ensure the top 0.01 percent pay taxes on their income as they go, just like everyone who earns a paycheck.\n\nRaising the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks from 1% to 4% to reduce the differential tax treatment between buybacks and dividends and encourage businesses to reinvest profits in their workers and in the company’s growth.\n\nDenying corporate tax deductions for employee compensation in excess of $1 million paid to any employee by both publicly and privately owned C corporations. \n\nClosing Medicare tax loopholes and extending solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund indefinitely by expanding the Net Investment Income Tax on income over $400,000 to cover all pass-through business income not otherwise covered by the Net Investment Income Tax or self-employment taxes, and by increasing the additional Medicare tax rate and the Net Investment Income Tax rate by 1.2 percentage points above $400,000 for a total Medicare tax rate of 5% on high-income taxpayers.\n\nLower costs for workers and families, by:\n\nMaking permanent expanded tax credits for health insurance that were first enacted in the American Rescue Plan and extended in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nExpanding the Child Tax Credit and making it fully refundable and available in advance monthly, a more practical solution to ensure that families can receive relief when they need it most instead of in one lump sum at the end of the year. In 2021, the expanded CTC cut child poverty nearly in half and helped bring child poverty to a historic low. \n\nExpanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to cover more workers without children.\n\nExpanding and enhancing the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, the largest federal incentive for affordable housing construction and rehabilitation, to boost the supply of housing that is affordable for low-income renters.\n\nMake additional smart, common-sense reforms to the tax code.\n\nClose the carried interest loophole that allows investment fund managers to reduce the taxes they owe on their earnings by characterizing them as investment gains rather than wages. \n\nClose estate and gift tax loopholes that allow the wealthy to reduce their tax by using complicated trust arrangements to transfer their assets to their heirs.\n\nClose life insurance loopholes that allow the wealthy to avoid tax on what are effectively customized investment products.  \n\n###\n\nUse featured image\n\nOff\n\nLatest News\n\nNovember 1, 2024\n\n    Treasury Issues Final Rule Expanding CFIUS Coverage of Real Estate Transactions Around More Than 60 Military Installations\n\n    U.S. Department of the Treasury’s CDFI Fund and Federal Housing Finance Agency Collaborate to Bolster CDFI Access to Capital\n\nOctober 31, 2024\n\n    Report on U.S. Portfolio Holdings of Foreign Securities at Year-End 2023\n\n    Treasury Sanctions Key Members of La Linea, a Group Involved in Trafficking Fentanyl into the United States\n\n    READOUT: Sixth Meeting of the Financial Working Group Between the United States and the People’s Republic of China"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:44:12.243027"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2476]]

For some households, increased housing costs means there is less to spend on everything else, including food, health care, clothing, education, and retirement savings.  For others, particularly younger Americans, high costs may be preventing them from living on their own or starting families. \n\nThe affordability challenge is particularly severe for households of color and for low-income communities. Black and Hispanic households tend to spend higher shares of their incomes on housing expenses than white households.[1]  And almost 90 percent of families with annual incomes below $20,000 spend more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing expenses—a threshold used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to indicate unaffordability. Sixty percent of families with incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 face the same challenge. These Americans are on the brink of being priced out of a basic human need. \n\nFor these urgent reasons, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to expand the supply of housing and bring down costs for renters and homebuyers, at the same time as pushing for significant action from Congress and state and local governments. In this blog, we describe some of the root causes of U.S. housing cost growth and the large and slow-moving demographic changes that have led us to where we are today, motivating the need for significant and concerted action.\n\nOur main takeaways are:\n\nOver the last two decades, housing costs have been rising faster than incomes. More than 90 percent of Americans live in counties where median rents and house prices grew faster than median incomes from 2000 to 2020.\n\nSince 2000, housing demand has grown more than housing supply. This is largely due to changing demographics: although the construction of housing has kept pace with overall population growth, it has fallen well short of the estimated number of housing units demanded by an aging population.\n\nThis is a longstanding problem, and substantial fixes will require federal legislative and state and local action.  But the Biden Administration is not waiting for Congress to act and has taken many steps across multiple agencies to increase housing supply. Over the past couple of years, Treasury’s actions include strengthening the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, implementing historic housing investments as part of the American Rescue Plan, supporting community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, and permanently extending the Federal Financing Bank’s financing support for a HUD risk-sharing initiative. Today, Secretary Yellen will outline additional efforts at Treasury to expand housing supply.\n\nI. Housing cost increases\n\nSince 2000, housing costs have been rising faster than median household income (Figure 1). Inflation-adjusted rents have grown steadily, to more than 20 percent above their 2000 level. Inflation-adjusted prices for single-family homes have grown even faster, with a large boom and bust leading up to the financial crisis of the late 2000s and then a particularly sharp increase in the years following the onset of the pandemic. Over the entire period, inflation-adjusted house prices rose about 65 percent. In contrast, inflation-adjusted median household income barely rose over the whole time period.\n\nFigure 1. Real Housing Price, Rent and Wage Indexes\n\nThis point is broadly true across regions. From 2000 to 2020, median rents rose faster than median household income in 88 percent of U.S. counties, home to 97 percent of the U.S. population (Figure 2). And median house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 88 percent of counties, home to 95 percent of the population (Figure 3). And both median rents and house prices grew faster than overall inflation in 77 percent of counties, home to 93 percent of the population. Rents and home prices also rose in rural and urban areas, and for both single-family homes and apartments in multi-family buildings.[2]  In sum, rising housing costs have been widespread and do not simply reflect a mismatch between locations and sectors in which housing is demanded and supplied. \n\nFigure 2: Growth in median rents less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020\n\nFigure 3: Growth in median housing values less growth in median income, 2000 to 2020\n\nII. Demographic Trends\n\nRising prices have resulted from growth in housing demand exceeding growth in housing supply. Over the last two decades, a major contributor to housing demand growth has been the changing demographic characteristics of the U.S. population. Notably, the population has aged. In 2000, people aged 55 and over made up 20 percent of the U.S. population; by 2020, the 55-and-over share was 30 percent. Older people are more likely to be the head of their own household, so as the population ages, demand for homes rises.[3] \n\nThe three panels of Figure 4 visually demonstrate the changing age distribution of housing demand in our population. The blue bars on the left side of each figure show the size of the population in each age range. The gray bars on the right side show the number of households headed by someone in each age range. As the baby boomers have moved from the youngest age ranges in 1980 to the middle age ranges in 2000 to the older age ranges in 2020, the distribution of housing demand has shifted notably.    \n\nFigure 4: Population and Households by Age\n\nOne way to understand the interaction between the aging population and housing demand is by calculating the share of each age group that is a head of household. That is simply the ratio of the gray bars on the right side of Figure 4 to the blue bars on the left. Those ratios are called “headship rates.” \n\nFigure 5 shows the headship rates for different age ranges over time. Two facts jump out. First, older age groups have higher headship rates. So, as the population ages, there will be upward pressure on the overall headship rate in the population—and, conversely, downward pressure on the number of people per household, all else equal.[4] Consequently, there will be upward pressure on the number of housing units demanded per person in the population.\n\nSecond, age-specific headship rates have been declining for the past few decades for every adult age group.[5]  One plausible explanation for declining headship rates is the rising housing costs detailed in the previous section. \n\nFigure 5: Per-Age Headship Rates\n\nThe youngest groups have experienced the largest declines in headship rates. In 1980, 50 percent of Americans aged 25 to 34 were heads of their own household (the lowest line on Figure 4). In 2020, that number had fallen to around 40 percent. The headship rate for Americans aged 35 to 44 also fell substantially: from almost 55 percent to less than 50 percent. The decline in headship rates for younger Americans can be seen in the rise of young adults living at home over the same period, as shown in Figure 6. This rise is at least partially attributable to rising rents and house prices.[6]\n\nFigure 6. Share of Adults Aged 25 to 34 Living with a Parent\n\nIII. Housing demand has outpaced supply\n\nHousing demand growth since 2000 can be assessed by calculating the number of homes that would be required to accommodate the current U.S. population if headship rates for each age group had stayed at their 2000 values. The top line of Figure 7 shows that calculation, estimating that housing demand grew by 26 percent between 2000 and 2020. \n\nBy comparison, Figure 7 shows that the actual housing stock—housing supply—grew by only 19 percent. So, the growth in housing demand has outpaced supply—a potentially important cause of rising rents and house prices. Population growth—the bottom line in Figure 7—grew by only 17 percent over this same period. \n\nIn short, housing cost increases have not arisen because population outpaced supply. It has not. Instead, housing cost increases have resulted from housing demand outpacing supply, driven in part by demographic shifts. \n\nFigure 7: Population, estimated housing demand, and housing stock percent growth since 2000\n\nIV. Why construction hasn’t kept up pace and the role of policy\n\nSo why hasn’t housing construction kept pace with the growth of housing demand? One cause of housing undersupply may be local land-use regulations and zoning restrictions.[7]  Minimum lot sizes and limits on multifamily apartment buildings can increase prices by limiting supply.[8] Loosening those regulations would remove barriers to new construction, expand housing supply, and lower the rents faced by all households, including those with lower incomes.[9] \n\nIn many places, and for many low-income households, barriers to construction are not the sole culprit. Many households’ incomes are simply too low to spur growth in the supply of reasonably safe and sanitary housing. The future rents they could afford to pay would be insufficient to cover the construction costs of new apartments or houses.[10] And new market-rate construction geared towards higher-income households only has limited success in opening affordable vacancies in older buildings.[11] \n\nGovernments—state, local, and Federal—have good reason to work towards overcoming these barriers to ensure a sufficient supply of affordable housing. Housing is a basic human need. Furthermore, investments in affordable housing support our economy’s medium- and long-run growth. Having an affordable home allows workers to live close to the high-quality jobs where they are most productive, which is particularly important give the ongoing resurgence in American manufacturing.[12] Moreover, there is an abundance of evidence that stable housing provides benefits to children that increase their future long-term success.[13] \n\nGovernment policy can support housing supply and affordability in numerous ways: by subsidizing housing construction, by subsidizing renters, by subsidizing home buyers, and by incentivizing state and local governments to remove outdated zoning and land use policies.[14] One of the Federal government’s largest sources of support for affordable housing is administered by Treasury: the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, which subsidizes the construction and preservation of affordable housing.\n\nV. Biden-Harris and Treasury Policies\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration and Treasury recognize the urgent need to address housing affordability.  In 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration released a Housing Supply Action Plan, which included actions across multiple agencies intended to create more affordable housing. In its latest budget, the Biden Administration has called on Congress to invest more than $175 billion to help grow housing supply, including through the expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The Administration has also encouraged state and local governments to work to reduce barriers to more housing construction.\n\nIn the meantime, Treasury is not waiting for Congress to act. Over the past few years, Treasury’s American Rescue Plan programs have enabled state and local governments to deploy billions of dollars to create new and improve existing affordable housing stock. Treasury has also supported the construction of affordable housing through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, the largest source of financing for affordable housing in the country, as well as Treasury’s support for community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions, which enable these institutions to make housing loans and investments to communities hit hardest by the pandemic. Earlier this year, in a blog post, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo announced a range of Treasury actions to help expand housing supply. \n\nToday, Secretary Janet Yellen is announcing several additional key housing initiatives in a speech in Minnesota. First, Treasury will be establishing a new program administered by the CDFI Fund that will provide an additional $100 million over the next three years to support the financing of affordable housing. Second, we are working on a major improvement to bolster the Federal Financing Bank’s financing of affordable housing through its support of HUD’s Section 542 Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative. This builds on the recent indefinite extension of the program, which is estimated to help preserve or create 38,000 affordable units over the next decade. Third, we are engaging with the Federal Home Loan Banks, which play a key role in the housing finance system, to explore ways that they can increase their voluntary commitments to housing programs. And fourth, the CDFI Fund is updating the Capital Magnet Fund rule to provide greater flexibility and reduce administrative burden on recipients, which reflects input that Treasury has received from stakeholders.\n\nThere will not be a quick fix to the long-term rise in housing costs. But the Federal and state and local governments play an important role in ensuring that all Americans have affordable and safe homes. The actions taken now are an important start, and the Administration is prioritizing laying the groundwork for larger legislative action when Congress is ready to act.\n\n \n\n[1] Specifically, in 2022, 57 and 54 percent of renting households with a Black or Hispanic head, respectively, spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses, as opposed to only 45 percent of renting households with a white head. More Than 42 Million US Households Were Cost Burdened in 2022 | Joint Center for Housing Studies (harvard.edu)\n\n[2] For multi-family rental price index, see Freddie Mac. For single-family home price index, see S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index.\n\n[3] See Figure 5. \n\n[4] Since headship rates have been declining for all age groups, the aggregate effect of an aging population on the number of people per household was muted. Nevertheless, the number of people per household did decrease slightly from 2.7 in 2000 to 2.6 in 2020. \n\n[5] Note that there is evidence of a decline in headship rates and subsequent rebound in 2020 due to changes in living arrangements related to the Covid-19 pandemic (see The Fed - The Remarkable Recent Rebound in Household Formation and the Prospects for Future Housing Demand (federalreserve.gov)). We believe our estimates of 2020 headship rates are likely unaffected by these within-2020 changes because we use data from the 5-year American Community Survey, which were collected from January 2016 to December 2020. While this time period covers the period in which the decline in headship rates and subsequent rebound have been documented, 2020 represents a relatively small share of the entire period during which the data used to generate these estimates were collected. \n\n[6] The Fed - The Long and the Short of Household Formation (federalreserve.gov)\n\n[7] E.g., Jason Furman, Barriers to Shared Growth: Land Use Regulation and Economic Rents (2015\n\n[8] For example, see Ihlanfeldt (2007) and Zabel and Dalton (2011).\n\n[9] JUE Insight: The effect of new market-rate housing construction on the low-income housing market - ScienceDirect\n\n[10] The cost of affordable housing: Does it pencil out?

Such trade agreements should prevent unwarranted data localization, recognizing that such commitments do not restrict a government’s right to adopt or maintain measures to protect personal data, personal privacy and the confidentiality of individual records and accounts, provided that such measures are not used to circumvent the data flow and localization commitments.\n\nDecember 3, 2020\n\nInsurance Response to Future Pandemics and Other Crises\n\nView subcommittee draft for background and additional detail on each recommendation (note: draft contains pre-amendment language and includes proposals not adopted by FACI)\n\nFACI recommends that FIO:\n\nreiterate the importance of insurance being deemed a business essential service and encourage federal and state regulators to allow for regulatory compliance efficiencies, coordinate, or take similar relief actions during a future pandemic or emergency, while ensuring consumers and investors continue to have timely access to critical services and information; and\n\ndevelop better ways to prepare for future crises and pandemics, both industry and regulators will need to plan to confront these challenges as part of resiliency planning for uninterrupted regulatory oversight and approvals as well as ongoing business operations. \n\nFACI recommends that FIO encourage regulatory agencies and insurers that have not already done so, either voluntarily or for purposes of satisfying regulatory requirements (e.g., ORSA), to develop strategies that address the key organizational challenges a pandemic poses in preparation for a future event.\n\nFACI believes it is appropriate that FIO engage various stakeholders to conduct a study of Federal and State regulations relating to the use of e-delivery in the insurance sector. The study should identify and explore existing regulatory barriers limiting insurers’ and customers’ ability to utilize the advantages of technological developments through the use of e-delivery, thereby enabling conduct of business in a manner consistent with today’s consumer expectations, subject to appropriate safeguards against fraud by parties subject to the transaction.\n\nThe study should summarize statutory and federal regulatory requirements relating to e-delivery for insurance products, identify ways to improve existing laws and regulations, including areas for increased regulatory flexibility and opportunities to harmonize any inconsistent laws and regulations.\n\nThe FIO should solicit input from regulators, insurers, consumers, and other stakeholders and examine disparities in internet access, often called the “digital divide”, as part of this study.\n\nFIO should encourage both Federal and state regulators to permit or, to the extent e-signature is already adopted, enhance the use of e-signature for insurance transactions and regulatory filings where appropriate and applicable. Regulators should be encouraged to review relevant insurance guidance and rules that require a signature to expressly allow that requirement to be satisfied by an e-signature, subject to appropriate safeguards against fraud by parties subject to the transaction.\n\nFIO should encourage state regulators that have not already done so to transition to electronic insurance company regulatory filings where appropriate and applicable, subject to appropriate safeguards against fraud by parties subject to the transaction.\n\nFIO should encourage state regulators that have not already done so to adopt online/remote training and examination options for producer licensing where possible, subject to appropriate safeguards against fraud by parties subject to the transaction.\n\nInternational Market Access\n\nView subcommittee draft for background and additional detail on each recommendation (note: draft contains pre-amendment language and includes proposals not adopted by FACI)\n\nFIO should advocate for Treasury and other federal departments and agencies with relevant jurisdiction and expertise - including the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative – to ensure the issues the Subcommittee has identified are considered and resolution sought when engaging in trade negotiations and bilateral consultations with foreign jurisdictions.\n\nAnalysis of which jurisdictions are engaging in the market access and level playing field issues the Subcommittee has identified should be expanded upon and maintained by the U.S. Government. FIO should advocate for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to request that the U.S. International Trade Commission undertake this work.\n\nWithin the framework of international agreements, FIO should advocate for Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to encourage relevant agencies and organizations to strengthen monitoring of international trade agreement implementation and enforcement of violations, including establishment of annual meetings of signatories to review implementation status and adherence to commitments and new approaches for early identification of issues and resolution of disputes.\n\nFIO should advocate for policies and standards at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) that prevent disparate supervision of market players operating in a jurisdiction.\n\nFIO should advocate for Treasury to pursue policies and standards at the Financial Stability Board (FSB) that prevent disparate supervision of market players operating in a jurisdiction.\n\nSeptember 29, 2020\n\nLong-Term Care Insurance\n\nView subcommittee draft for background and additional detail on each recommendation\n\nIdentify key issues/metrics that should be part of market monitoring for [LTCI combination and limited LTCI] products.\n\nIdentify current information about participants, sales,

needed to ensure timely execution on the milestones laid out in Abu Dhabi.\n\nContinue successful [ICS] engagement model, comprising both:\n\nActive and coordinated collaboration across Team USA, with the goal of negotiating the more granular and technical elements necessary to fulfilling the IAIS commitment to a viable approach to Comparability.\n\nFrequent and transparent stakeholder engagement, with a view to soliciting feedback on the technical and political milestones that lie ahead on the pathway to Comparability.\n\nExecute substantively on the outcome from Abu Dhabi, which FACI believes should include:\n\nIntegration of Aggregation into all relevant aspects of the ICS work plan during the Monitoring Period.\n\nA methodical, objective, and evidence-based clarification of the potential ambiguities inherent in the published IAIS Comparability definition and principles.\n\nContinued technical enhancements to the ICS, particularly with a view to aligning the ICS design more closely with U.S. business models and capital management practices.\n\nReinforcement of the IAIS messaging that ICS ratio reporting (i) is non-mandatory and provisional in nature, (ii) must remain strictly confidential and should not be disclosed by individual insurers (even on a voluntary basis), and (iii) should not be used by third parties for assessing insurer financial strength during the Monitoring Period.\n\nSeptember 23, 2019\n\nInsurance Capital Standard (ICS) Engagement Strategy\n\nView subcommittee draft for background and additional detail on each recommendation\n\nTo ensure a successful outcome [at the IAIS Annual Meeting in November 2019], FACI urges continued strong collaboration between FIO and its NAIC and Federal Reserve negotiating partners within “Team USA”—with the ultimate goal of securing an agreement at the IAIS that lays a credible pathway for international acceptance of the U.S. “Aggregation” approach to insurance group regulatory capital.\n\nFACI also sees FIO playing a vital role in helping to support the NAIC’s education, outreach, and advocacy with IAIS members on the “Aggregation” approach – by helping to explain the process, substance, and value proposition of the Aggregation approach being designed by the NAIC.\n\nFACI also believes that, contingent on the outcome of the IAIS meeting, FIO and its “Team USA” partners should consider issuing a joint public statement to both re-assert and clarify the U.S. position on:\n\nThe pathway forward for Aggregation.\n\nThe structure and design of ICS 2.0.\n\nThe intended approach to the 5-year Monitoring Period.\n\nComparability Assessment of U.S. &quot;Aggregation&quot; Approach\n\nView subcommittee draft for background and additional detail on each recommendation\n\nFACI urges FIO, along with its “Team USA” partners at the IAIS Executive Committee, to prioritize, as its key focal point within ICS negotiations: advocacy for the U.S. Aggregation approach being developed by NAIC.  As elements of this advocacy, FACI proposes that FIO, along with “Team USA”, should highlight:\n\nThe significant work achieved by the NAIC’s Group Capital Calculation Working Group since its inception in February 2016, which has conducted multiple consultations, open hearings, and quantitative field testing.\n\nThe value proposition of an Aggregation style approach in reflecting the primacy of entity-level jurisdictional requirements in how the industry manages capital; and providing greater insight into the legitimate similarities and differences across various local regimes.\n\nThe importance of jurisdictional flexibility as a key tenet of prudential oversight and tailoring of insurance regulations to local markets and circumstances.\n\nThe unproven and untested nature of the ICS 2.0, including design issues, concerns about the validity of “best efforts” valuations, and the potential for pro-cyclicality across changing market environments.\n\nFACI also recommends that FIO and “Team USA” should urge the IAIS to issue a clear and well-specified communication (at or before its November meeting) that lays out, in tangible and granular detail, the work-plan and approaches underlying Comparability assessments.\n\nFACI recommends that the following framework be utilized for determining the comparability of any jurisdiction's group capital assessment regime applicable to internationally active insurance groups (or IAIGs) and incorporated into the IAIS communication referred to above:\n\nThe primary criterion for assessing the comparability of a group capital assessment regime should be whether it provides a comparable level of policyholder protection and contributes to global financial stability.\n\nA comparable group capital assessment regime should include a worldwide group capital calculation capturing risk at the level of the entire group, including the worldwide parent undertaking of the insurance or reinsurance group, which may affect the group's insurance or reinsurance operations and activities.\n\nA comparable group capital assessment regime should recognize and value all material liabilities and capital resources in a consistent, objective and reliable manner.\n\nThe group wide supervisor should have the authority to impose preventive, corrective, or otherwise responsive measures on the basis of the group capital assessment, including requiring, where authorized, capital measures, as a result of the group capital assessment.\n\nA comparable group capital assessment must not undermine existing jurisdictional capital requirements.\n\nICS Monitoring Period\n\nView subcommittee draft for background and additional detail on each recommendation\n\nFACI recommends that FIO push for a candid framing and coherent design of the so-called “Monitoring Period” – ideally, with a formal IAIS statement issued at the IAIS Annual Meeting that comprises the following messages:\n\nThe IAIS plans to execute on a credible, well-specified process for assessing Comparability of “Aggregation” and other alternative approaches.\n\nImplementation of ICS 2.0 for IAIGs remains the authority of the respective group-wide supervisors, and as such, the form and timing of final ICS 2.0 implementation are unknown at the beginning of the monitoring period. Local regulators will make the final decision on the form and timing of ICS implementation in their jurisdiction.\n\nICS 2.0 is a work in progress and may be subject to substantial changes before final implementation. The 5-year period starting in 2020 is not, therefore, simply a “phase in” of ICS 2.0 for adoption as a prescribed capital standard in 2025, but rather an opportunity to assess the validity of the standard and address issues with the standard before implementation. Of note, the appropriate recognition of long-term guarantee business in ICS 2.0 remains a key area of ongoing development.\n\nBoth the form and timing of the final ICS 2.0 implementation are subject to the results of a public consultation process and market impact studies to be conducted during the monitoring period and focused on impacts on financial stability, the macro-economy and consumers.\n\nIn the context of these uncertainties and concerns, any ICS 2.0 results reported by companies during the Monitoring Period will not be indicative of capital positions and could well misrepresent a company’s financial strength.\n\nHolistic Framework for Systemic Risk Assessment\n\nView subcommittee draft for background and additional detail on each recommendation\n\nFACI recommends a continued focus on the following five substantive themes [of the IAIS Holistic Framework]:\n\nPromoting a true cross-sectoral activities-based approach, which places insurance within the proper context of financial services more broadly.\n\nEnsuring that macro-prudential surveillance does not become a monolithic, overengineered data mining exercise.\n\nEnsuring that the IAIS approach does not overtly single out or discriminate against U.S. insurance products, particularly well-established products such as annuities that play an important role in U.S. retirement planning.\n\nDeferring to local supervisors as the primary and accountable authorities for systemic risk oversight.\n\nThe ABA should be implemented based on a principle of proportionality, based on an insurer’s exposure to potential systemically-risky activities."], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:44:37.000092"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2478]]

I very much appreciate SIFMA’s invitation to be a part of today’s discussion. I had the opportunity to speak with SIFMA’s AML Committee earlier this year, and I valued that dialogue and your insights. The perspectives of your industry are incredibly important, particularly given our current priorities.\n\nIt is an extremely busy time at FinCEN, so, in our time today, I would like to provide an update on our recent efforts to promote additional transparency in the U.S. financial system; strengthen the U.S. anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, or AML/CFT, system to align with international standards; and advance the U.S. strategy on countering corruption. Specifically, I’ll address our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for investment advisers, provide an update on FinCEN’s efforts to implement the Corporate Transparency Act, and discuss the value of the information that your industry provides to FinCEN and law enforcement, among a few other areas of focus.\n\n \n\nInvestment Advisers NPRM\n\nAs you know, FinCEN issued a proposed rule in February that would require certain investment advisers to implement risk-based AML/CFT programs, report suspicious activity to FinCEN, and fulfill other recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\n\nThe investment adviser sector is a key entry point to the U.S. financial system, facilitating the investment of tens of trillions of dollars by individuals, corporations, and retirement plans, among others. Yet investment advisers are not subject to comprehensive AML/CFT regulations in the United States.\n\nWe have observed how unscrupulous actors have exploited this sector to access the U.S. financial system for nefarious purposes. We’ve identified instances in which corrupt officials, tax evaders, other criminals, and sanctioned individuals have gained access to U.S. securities, real estate, and other assets through investment advisers.\n\nThese are not new risks. In 2003 and 2015, Treasury proposed applying AML requirements to investment advisers, but those proposed rules were never finalized. Since 2015, the sector has almost doubled in assets under management, and we have developed an increasingly detailed understanding of the illicit finance and national security risks associated with this sector.\n\nRight now, there is a patchwork of regulatory coverage in the investment adviser sector. Certain advisers implement some AML measures because they are dually registered as broker dealers, are affiliated with banks or bank subsidiaries, or are part of a financial holding company already subject to these requirements.\n\nThese gaps in regulation allow illicit investors to “shop around” for an adviser who does not need to inquire into their source of wealth. It also creates an unfair playing field in the sector, as different advisers are required to play by different rules.\n\nAlongside the proposed rule, Treasury published a risk assessment specific to the investment adviser sector, which I hope you will find useful. The risk assessment identified several cases where current or former investment advisers laundered illicit proceeds for corrupt foreign officials, fraudsters, and tax evaders.\n\nA FinCEN review of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting identified several venture capital funds serving as an entry point into the U.S. financial system for Russian oligarchs, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has several ongoing investigations of sanctions evasion through U.S. venture capital and private funds.\n\nWe also identified the extent to which investment advisers and their advised funds, particularly venture capital funds, are being used by foreign states, most notably China and Russia, to access certain technology and services with long-term national security implications through investments in early-stage companies. An analysis of BSA reporting identified several U.S. venture capital firms with significant ties to Russian oligarchs that invested in firms developing emerging technologies with national security applications.\n\nThe risk assessment also noted that the highest risk in the investment adviser sector was among exempt reporting advisers, followed by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-registered investment advisers, and then followed by registered investment advisers that are not dually registered as, or affiliated with, a broker-dealer or a bank.\n\nOur current proposal aims to address these risks. We worked hard to tailor the proposal to address national security and illicit finance concerns, while minimizing potential burden on U.S. businesses. We designed the proposed rule to be risk-based, such that smaller advisers may adopt tailored policies and procedures that are consistent with their (often) simpler, more centralized organizational structures.\n\nThe proposed rule would also bring the United States into conformity with international standards and address a significant gap in our AML/CFT system identified in the 2016 U.S. mutual evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international standard-setter for fighting financial crime. The next FATF mutual evaluation of the United States is fast approaching in 2026, and it is important that we move quickly to address this deficiency and remain a global leader in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\n \n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nWhile I am on the subject of proposed rules, our attention is not only on the investment adviser sector. At a time when residential real estate is more expensive than ever and some of our biggest cities are experiencing affordable housing crises, money launderers are exploiting the U.S. housing market and buying homes anonymously to wash their illicitly gained funds. Left unchecked, real estate money laundering can distort housing market prices and make it even more difficult for the average American to afford a home. FinCEN published a notice of proposed rulemaking in February to bring greater transparency to the residential real estate sector that, if finalized, would increase transparency and combat and deter money laundering in the U.S. housing market.\n\nWe are also considering next steps with regard to addressing the illicit finance risks associated with the U.S. commercial real estate sector.\n\nThe public comments for both the investment adviser and residential real estate proposed rules were robust. We received hundreds of comments, which are under thorough review, and Treasury officials had the opportunity to engage directly with a range of advocacy groups during a series of roundtables on both topics.\n\nUltimately, hearing a variety of perspectives leads to strong, practical, and effective regulations, and we’re looking forward to continuing the rulemaking process to better protect U.S. economic and national security.\n\n \n\nCorporate Transparency Act\n\nAnother significant priority for FinCEN in our anti-corruption and AML/CFT modernization efforts is our implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act, which requires certain companies doing business in the United States to report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. Those requirements went into effect on January 1, 2024, and are commanding a great deal of our attention.\n\nIn designing the reporting framework, we worked hard to minimize potential burden on the companies required to report. Filing with FinCEN is simple, secure, and free, and for companies with simple ownership structures, it may only take about 20 minutes. We’ve already received more than 1.7 million beneficial ownership information reports and are working tirelessly to get the word out to small businesses and their networks.\n\nWe’re working hard to meet small business owners where they are—by partnering with agencies like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Small Business Administration; publishing multimedia guidance and answers to frequently asked questions, collaborating with secretaries of state; educating trusted service providers like accountants and registered agents; reaching members of trade and industry associations; participating in both in-person and virtual events; and beginning a paid media campaign that encompasses digital, print, radio, streaming, and TV. We’re fully committed to ensuring that the filed reports yield a useful database to fulfill the law enforcement and national security purposes laid out in the Corporate Transparency Act.\n\nWe are working toward a phased approach to providing access to beneficial ownership information. The first stage will be a pilot program for a handful of key Federal agency users that we expect to begin very soon. The second stage will extend access to Treasury offices and certain Federal agencies engaged in law enforcement and national security activities that already have Memoranda of Understanding for access to BSA information.\n\nSubsequent stages will extend access to additional Federal agencies engaged in law enforcement, national security, and intelligence activities, as well as to State, local, and Tribal law enforcement partners; to intermediary Federal agencies in connection with foreign government requests; and finally, to financial institutions and their supervisors. We expect that financial institutions subject to customer due diligence obligations will receive access in Spring 2025.\n\n \n\nAML Act Implementation\n\nBeyond these anti-corruption and transparency efforts, we remain focused on our implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (or, the AML Act). The AML Act included transformational changes to FinCEN’s core authorities, with the overall goal of strengthening, modernizing, and streamlining the existing AML regime by promoting innovation, regulatory reform, and industry and stakeholder engagement.\n\nWe recognize the importance of full implementation of the AML Act to make the framework more effective and risk-based. The issuance of an updated AML program rule is a foundational part of this effort, and we intend to issue a proposed rule this year that includes regulatory amendments that would ensure that AML/CFT programs incorporate the National AML/CFT Priorities, and are effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed.\n\nWhen we issued the Priorities in June 2021, we encouraged financial institutions to assess their risk exposure to those Priorities while we work on implementing regulations. We recognize that financial institutions have been anxiously waiting for a proposed rule to see how they will be required or expected to incorporate the Priorities into their AML/CFT programs.\n\nWe view revising the AML/CFT program rule consistently with the AML Act to be a substantial step in a multi-year and multi-step effort to transition to a more effective and risk-based AML/CFT framework.\n\n \n\nRussia\n\nIn addition to these efforts, FinCEN continues its work across our broad and growing mandate to support law enforcement and national security agencies. First, we are prioritizing the targeting of Russian money laundering and sanctions and export control evasion activities.\n\nIn response to Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, FinCEN published numerous Alerts to help financial institutions further identify and report suspicious transactions related to potential Russia-related money laundering, and sanctions and export control evasion activities. And we have been analyzing BSA reports filed in response to these Alerts to identify trends and patterns. In September of 2023, FinCEN published a Financial Trend Analysis summarizing some of the findings of that analysis as it relates to BSA reporting related to Russia-related export control evasion. The Alerts and the Financial Trend Analysis are available on our website.\n\nDrawing from that reporting, FinCEN has also been able to conduct and contribute to investigations involving: Russia-related sanctions evasion; violations of the price cap on Russian oil exports; trust and company service providers that obfuscate the wealth of Russian elites; and entities that export dual use technology to Russia’s defense sector, the precious metals sector, and Russian private military companies.\n\nYour reporting is providing us with visibility into the financial networks of Russian proliferators, shell companies, fronts, and other professional enablers—leading to new investigations and bolstered existing investigations. These efforts have led to law enforcement actions and civil and administrative actions against a variety of illicit actors. Further, we have partnered particularly closely with OFAC and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which both use BSA data in targeting and enforcement work, and tell us that BSA reports have furthered their ability to leverage their authorities and further disrupt organizations attempting to circumvent Russia-related sanctions.\n\nCountering Russian illicit finance, sanctions and export control evasion, and supporting the U.S. Government’s efforts in response to the ongoing war, remain priorities for FinCEN and the Department of the Treasury, and we will continue to evaluate how our tools and authorities can best be utilized in those efforts.\n\n \n\nTerrorist Financing\n\nI also want to spend a few moments discussing our efforts to help financial institutions detect, prevent, and report suspicious activity that may be tied to the financing of Hamas and its revenue streams around the world, including entities located in third countries that may be abetting Hamas’s fundraising machinations.\n\nThe attacks by Hamas against Israel on October 7, 2023, were horrific and only underscored the importance of countering terrorist financing as a core mission of Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, including FinCEN.\n\nShortly after the attack, FinCEN issued an alert containing red flags that FinCEN identified to help financial institutions identify and report suspicious activity connected to funding streams supporting Hamas. Hamas’s revenue streams include—or have traditionally included— support from Iran; private donations; a global portfolio of investments; the control of border crossings and avenues of commerce; racketeering business frameworks; extortionary practices around local populations; and fundraising campaigns involving virtual currency and sham charities raising both fiat and virtual currency. Some of those streams have been impacted by the war in Gaza, which Hamas has de facto controlled since 2007.\n\nAs a result of this Alert, FinCEN has received over 200 BSA filings. Filers have reported suspicious transactions involving suspected sham charities, potential online fundraising using social media and cryptocurrencies, the purchase of weapons and tactical gear destined for the Middle East, and the use of likely shell companies to obscure the purpose of financial activities.\n\nFinCEN is actively analyzing this information and collaborating with law enforcement and other partners to support investigations and actions to disrupt these terrorist financing networks. Please know that reporting coming in as a result of the Alert will be incredibly valuable to the whole-of-government efforts to deny Hamas the ability to raise funds worldwide for its terrorist activities.\n\n \n\nEnforcement and Compliance Efforts\n\nI would now like to turn to some of FinCEN’s more recent enforcement and compliance-related work, which has long been a critical component of FinCEN’s mission. Those who follow the enforcement space have likely noticed FinCEN becoming increasingly active on these issues, which is consistent with our efforts across various workstreams to increase enforcement by strategically deploying our resources. A significant component of such efforts is FinCEN’s commitment to implementing, and realizing the full potential of, its new Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Whistleblower Program.\n\nThis program holds tremendous potential as an enforcement force-multiplier. Whistleblowers have submitted information relating to some of the most pressing policy objectives of the United States, from Iran- and Russia-related sanctions evasion to drug-trafficking to cyber-crimes and corruption. While efforts are underway to develop an online tip intake portal and other aspects of this important program, I want to note that even while these efforts are underway, the program is actively receiving, reviewing, and sharing tips with our enforcement partners.\n\nWe have received over 270 unique tips since the program’s inception, and many of the tips received have been highly relevant to many of Treasury’s top priorities. Whistleblowers who voluntarily submit original information to FinCEN about certain violations of the BSA or economic sanctions could be awarded between 10 to 30 percent of penalties collected if their information leads to successful enforcement actions.\n\nI do also want to highlight an action that FinCEN took last November, when FinCEN imposed a landmark $3.4 billion civil money penalty against Binance, the world’s largest virtual asset provider. FinCEN’s penalties reflect the breadth and significance of Binance’s BSA violations, which included:\n\nFailing to Register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business (MSB): Binance claimed to have exited the U.S. market years ago, but did not actually do so, retaining U.S. users and other significant ties with the United States.\n\nFailure to Develop, Implement, and Maintain an Effective AML Program: Binance initially failed to develop an AML program, and its subsequent program contained critical gaps that included failing to conduct Know Your Customer processes on large swaths of its users, a lack of risk-based procedures for various offerings, and instructing staff to withhold information from law enforcement.\n\nFailure to Report Suspicious Transactions: Binance’s lack of AML controls allowed illicit actors to transact freely, supporting activities from child sexual abuse, to illegal narcotics, to terrorism, across more than 100,000 transactions. That includes transactions associated with terrorist groups like Hamas’s Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Al Qaeda, and ISIS. Binance processed these transactions, but it never filed a single suspicious activity report (SAR) with FinCEN.\n\nFinCEN’s resolution with Binance, along with those of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and OFAC, recognize the role that cryptocurrency companies play in our financial system. As with financial institutions that offer services in fiat currency, willful evasions of U.S. law will be subject to severe repercussions and remediation of the relevant conduct.\n\n \n\nValue of BSA Data\n\nI would also like to take some time to share a bit more about what we are seeing in SAR filings by your industry, the value of this information to law enforcement, and the importance of information sharing.\n\nFinCEN received nearly 119,000 SARs from securities and futures filers between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2024. This averages almost 5,000 SARs a month. Automated Clearing House (ACH) fraud, identity theft, wire transfer fraud, check fraud, and suspicious wire transfers were the most frequently reported suspicious activity subtypes.\n\nOf the top 15 suspicious activity subtypes, the largest percentage increases in reporting from the prior year were for embezzlement, theft, or disappearance of funds—which saw a 34 percent increase—and elder financial exploitation, which increased 63 percent.\n\nActivities most frequently reported in the “other” free text field included “free riding,” new account fraud, and money mule schemes.\n\nSAR information is incredibly valuable to law enforcement and other stakeholder for identifying leads and mapping illicit finance networks. Most SARs filed in this time period referenced fraud and/or some form of money laundering activity. About 17 percent mentioned cyber-related terms and about 90 SARs referenced terms related to fentanyl.\n\nIn particular, I would like to highlight an investigation that was successful due, in part, to SAR reporting by several broker dealers. This case was the recipient of a FinCEN Law Enforcement Award last year. In this case, the IRS, Criminal Investigation; Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General investigated a massive pandemic relief fraud ring that operated at the height of the COVID‐19 pandemic.\n\nThe investigation began shortly after the Attorney General’s creation of the COVID‐19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force. The team was originally tasked with investigating 10 loans made under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020. Investigators quickly used the information found in BSA filings to identify additional fraud and linked the initial list of 10 loans to more than 150 loans totaling approximately $21 million in fraud.\n\nBecause the defendants used fictitious identities and a vast network of bank accounts to commit the fraud and launder the proceeds, investigators also used the public-private information-sharing program FinCEN administers pursuant to section 314(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act to identify additional bank accounts for their investigation. The 314(a) program responses led investigators to additional fraud schemes and, combined with traditional law enforcement tactics, eventually led investigators to the true identity of the culprits. BSA filings were also essential in identifying relationships between co-defendants. Prior to their sentencing, the main defendants fled the United States and became international fugitives.\n\nAgain, investigators used BSA data—including SARs filed by broker dealers—to sniff out the financial trail. Investigators were able to run queries through FinCEN’s databases and identify accounts that the suspects opened at cryptocurrency exchanges using the same fictitious identities that were used to perpetrate the original fraud. Investigators also discovered that the defendants were applying for additional loans post‐indictment and even during trial.\n\nEventually, the financial trail led investigators to discover the whereabouts of the fugitives. International cooperation resulted in extradition of the defendants. All eight defendants have been sentenced, with the ringleaders receiving sentences of 17 years and nearly 11 years. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, and the DOJ Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecuted this case.\n\n \n\nSAR Tips and Information Sharing\n\nSo again, thank you to those broker dealers who helped the investigators piece together and successfully prosecute this case.\n\nGiven the high-value of this reporting, I would like to also share some value-creating practices that FinCEN has found increases the value and utility of a financial institution’s SARs.\n\nFirst: Include a “bottom-line-up-front” paragraph at the beginning of each SAR narrative. Clearly identify and explain why the activity is suspicious within the first paragraph of the narrative. This helps law enforcement quickly understand the potential importance and scope of the reported activity and triage its further review and analysis.\n\nSecond: Include a citation to – or clear explanation of – the source of any external information triggering the determination that the activity was suspicious. For example, if the triggering event is a press report highlighting a connection to an OFAC sanctioned entity or person, provide a citation to the press report. Or, if the triggering event is consistency with red flags from a FinCEN Alert related to Russia, reference the alert and include the requested keyword in Field 2 and the Narrative. This helps law enforcement understand the full context and identify potential relevance or links to other data sources.\n\nThird: Identify any links to foreign countries, including, for instance, IP addresses. Identifying such links gives FinCEN, as the financial intelligence unit (FIU) for the United States, the opportunity to collaborate with FIUs in other countries, as well as their law enforcement and government partners.\n\n314(b) Program\n\nI do have one last best practice I would like to share, which is really more of a plug for information sharing through our 314(b) program.\n\nI was very encouraged to learn that we currently have approximately 1,700 securities firms already registered to share information under section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act. This comprises over 20 percent of all registered financial institutions and is second only to depository institutions. So, thank you to those who are already registered and actively sharing information under this program.\n\nFor those of you who may not be a part of the program, we strongly encourage you to participate and look for opportunities to form associations to engage in voluntary information sharing. And for those already registered, I encourage you to continue to use, and potentially expand, existing processes to collect and share information in furtherance of investigations that involve cross-border activity.\n\nFinCEN truly views information sharing as one of the most powerful tools to help enhance compliance with AML/CFT requirements.\n\nOne of the most valuable uses of 314(b) information sharing is alerting other participating financial institutions to customers whose suspicious activities they may not have been previously aware. Relatedly, 314(b) information sharing facilitates the filing of more comprehensive SARs than would otherwise be filed.\n\nIn cases where a financial institution files a SAR that has benefited from section 314(b) information sharing, FinCEN encourages financial institutions to note this in the narrative. Doing so not only provides useful context for law enforcement, it also helps FinCEN identify and communicate specific examples of the benefits of the section 314(b) program.\n\nTo that end, FinCEN updated its SAR User Guide in August 2021 to request financial institutions include the sentence “This SAR contains 314(b) data.” in the narrative for such cases. The most up-to-date version of this user guide can always be found on our BSA E-Filing website.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nI know I have covered quite a bit of ground today in our time together, but I believe it speaks to the broad scope of FinCEN’s mission and the range of functions that FinCEN performs as we work to address the various illicit finance threats facing our country. In some ways, I feel like I just scratched the surface, and to that end, you will be hearing more from my FinCEN colleagues today on both the enforcement and CTA panels.\n\nThank you again and enjoy the rest of the conference.\n\n###"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:44:58.372424"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2480]]

Let me begin by thanking the Puerto Rico Bankers Association for the opportunity, and more importantly for their consistent work in bringing public and private stakeholders together each year to tackle the challenges we face across the illicit finance landscape. Events like this can help to freshen our perspectives, focus our attention, and find common ground to address the most pressing security issues that face the United States and our partners and allies around the globe.\n\nI am relatively new as the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and I appreciate that this visit to Puerto Rico has given me the opportunity to become more familiar with the important issues facing Puerto Rican financial institutions. I’m incredibly grateful for the warm welcome I have received, and I look forward to discussing the importance of this jurisdiction for the United States, for the Caribbean region, and, indeed, for global financial systems.\n\nIllicit financial activity is a common thread through nearly every criminal and security threat the United States faces. Most crime is simply for profit, and most national security threats necessarily require financing. In an increasingly interconnected world, this means that it is imperative that we get things right and expertly coordinate to maximize our impact.\n\nPuerto Rico presents significant risks for money laundering, but also significant potential and cause for optimism. As discussed in the 2024 U.S. National Money Laundering Risk Assessment, Treasury has taken several actions against International Banking Entities and International Financial Entities that operate in Puerto Rico, which is something I’ll return to at the end of my remarks. However, despite the known risks, there has been significant progress in recent memory, with landmark prosecutions, other enforcement actions, and new rules imposed.\n\nToday I’d like to spend time sharing how FinCEN is contributing to that progress, I hope, by addressing some of the most significant gaps in the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and exposing specific risk factors, trends, and typologies—particularly with respect to some of the predicate offenses that I know are of greatest concern here and throughout the region: corruption, fraud, and narcotics trafficking. I’ll also recap our recent approach to enforcement, and highlight some cases that I hope will provide valuable lessons learned for the audience. But first, because I know this audience comes from a diversity of backgrounds and experience levels, I’d like to quickly begin by talking about what exactly it is that FinCEN does.\n\nUnderstanding FinCEN\n\nI trust that many in this room know about or have at least heard of FinCEN. One thing that I can say since joining is that I have been struck by the range of functions that the organization performs. Let me go into a bit more detail about a few of the components that make up our work.\n\nFirst, we work to issue regulations intended to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other forms of illicit finance. Those regulations require, among other things, that approximately 300,000 financial institutions report timely and accurate information under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regarding suspicious activity and certain transactions.\n\nSecond, in addition to providing access to that information to law enforcement and other agencies—through more than 470 memoranda of understanding involving more than 14,000 users—we have teams of analysts who examine the data using advanced analytic tools and techniques to map illicit networks, identify trends and typologies, and isolate targets for investigation and enforcement.\n\nThird, the nature of FinCEN’s work makes our collaboration with external stakeholders, including our global partners and allies, critical to shared success. Domestically, our relationship with U.S. financial institutions and other private sector entities is truly a partnership. You all are on the front lines of this work daily, and we want to support that wherever we can. We issue advisories to drive further reporting on priority risks to the U.S. financial system and national security, and host public-private events to discuss everything from ideas for improving our overall regulatory regime to details on criminal schemes and typologies. On the international front, we are fortunate to engage and share information with a global network of 170 FIUs—also known as the Egmont Group—as well as fellow regulatory and supervisory bodies around the world, to bolster our analysis and promote criminal justice at home and abroad.\n\nFinally, we employ various tools to hold illicit or noncompliant actors to account. In addition to our rigorous support of civil and criminal investigations by other agencies, FinCEN imposes civil money penalties when U.S. financial institutions fail to comply with the BSA’s important mandate. FinCEN also imposes restrictions or reporting requirements on financial institutions that relate to foreign institutions or certain activities outside the United States that are deemed to be of “primary money laundering concern.”\n\nAnd of course, we are busily implementing the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), including the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which broadened FinCEN’s authorities significantly. I will turn to this next, in the context of our efforts to support the United States Strategy on Countering Corruption.\n\nPriority Predicate Crimes\n\nCorruption\n\nCore to FinCEN’s mission is safeguarding the integrity of the U.S. financial system, which necessarily means combating corruption and its proceeds. FinCEN’s reporting and analysis on this topic, including as described in our 2022 advisory on kleptocracy and public corruption, has made clear that corrupt actors continue to exploit vulnerabilities to launder and hide illicit proceeds. Three specific regulatory efforts have been underway that are addressing some of these vulnerabilities, and advancing the United States Strategy on Countering Corruption that was issued in December 2021 and remains in effect.\n\nBeneficial Ownership\n\nFirst, and most significantly, is FinCEN’s ongoing implementation of the CTA. Around the world, opaque corporate structures make it easier to conceal illicit activity and launder ill-gotten gains, and in the case of corrupt actors, facilitate theft from innocent populations often for direct personal gain. As the largest economy in the world and home to so many companies, the United States must do its part to align with global AML/CFT regulatory standards and establish a robust beneficial ownership reporting regime.\n\nOn January 1, 2024, the regulations that implement the CTA’s reporting requirements went into effect, and FinCEN successfully launched the beneficial ownership registry. Now many companies doing business in the United States must report identifying information about who directly or indirectly owns or controls them. Since launching, we’ve already received more than 642,000 filings and are working tirelessly both to get the word out to affected stakeholders and ensure the process for filing reports is quick, simple, and free.\n\nAs reporting companies continue to file beneficial ownership information reports, FinCEN aims to provide access to beneficial ownership information to certain authorized recipients, such as law enforcement agencies, in phases. Access to beneficial ownership information will enhance our law enforcement colleagues’ abilities to investigate, prosecute, and disrupt financial crimes; it will also facilitate compliance by financial institutions with their customer due diligence requirements.\n\nReal Estate\n\nSecond, we are shining a light on non-financed real estate transactions with a significant proposed rulemaking, which was published on February 16. For many years now, FinCEN has advanced its efforts to prevent corrupt and other illicit actors from misusing opaque legal entities to make non-financed (i.e., all-cash) purchases of residential real estate to launder or hide the proceeds of crime, including through our nearly decade-long Residential Real Estate Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) program. Through this program, FinCEN has collected information about these kinds of transactions in certain jurisdictions across the United States.\n\nThe proposed rulemaking will be an important step toward bringing greater transparency to this sector. We are also considering next steps with regard to addressing the illicit finance risks associated with the U.S. commercial real estate sector. There have been plenty of indications of money laundering through real estate here in Puerto Rico, including with ties to the drug trade. An interesting case is that of Vladimir Natera-Abreu, who was charged with—and in November of 2022 pleaded guilty to—a conspiracy to distribute various hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and oxycodone. This conspiracy involved the purchase of real estate properties in Guaynabo with proceeds of narcotics trafficking.\n\nInvestment Advisers\n\nThird, we are working to address the risks associated with investment advisers with another significant proposed rulemaking issued last week. At present, investment advisers are not subject to consistent or comprehensive AML/CFT obligations in the United States, creating the risk that corrupt officials and other illicit actors may invest ill-gotten gains in the U.S. financial system through hedge funds, private equity firms, and other investment services. FinCEN’s proposed rule would apply BSA requirements, including AML compliance program and suspicious activity reporting obligations, to certain investment advisers.\n\nEach of these three efforts will bring greater transparency and accountability to business and other transactional activity in the United States. With these actions, we are fortifying our existing regulatory architecture and simultaneously reiterating our longstanding and clear message: the United States is not and will not be a haven for dirty money, no matter how it is acquired or from where it comes.\n\nFraud\n\nThere is no shortage of serious fraud schemes and criminals who concoct the next big scam to target unwitting victims. FinCEN continues to identify, expose, and assist the private sector and the public at large with the detection of fraud schemes of considerable variety and novelty.\n\nIn the past several years, we have published multiple products on fraud, whether related to COVID-19 programs; elder financial exploitation; check fraud; or payroll tax evasion.\n\nThis past September, we issued a new advisory targeting so-called “Pig Butchering” schemes, in which perpetrators often located overseas, typically in Asia, cold contact a victim and attempt to establish rapport and slowly build trust, get them to invest in an opportunity often related to cryptocurrency, and then steal everything they can.\n\nTo give you an idea of what has been observed in Puerto Rico suspicious activity report (SAR) metrics by our team:\n\nMore than 47,000 SARs were filed between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023 that listed Puerto Rico as the activity branch location.\n\nNationally, check fraud was the largest fraud suspicious activity category. Although it was not as frequently cited in Puerto Rico-related filings, reports of suspected check fraud did increase by 66% from the previous year.\n\nSuspected money laundering was the most frequently reported suspicious activity subtype. Specific examples include transactions out of pattern, transactions below the recordkeeping threshold, and suspicious use of multiple locations.\n\nSome of the largest percentage increases in reporting were for transactions involving a high-risk jurisdiction and for those involving healthcare or health insurance.\n\nIn the “Other” free text fields, SAR filers commonly reported a high volume of financial activity, concerns about the destination of funds, high dollar amounts, and possible tax evasion. In terms of scams being reported, Good Samaritan scams and online purchase scams, mostly for vehicle purchases and services, were most frequently reported. In addition, almost 700 SARs in Puerto Rico described possible fraud related to Government assistance or benefits.\n\nNarcotics Trafficking\n\nI would now like to turn to the nation’s opioid crisis, which continues to carry high costs for communities across the country, to include Puerto Rico. Recent law enforcement cases have shown that Puerto Rico is an important transshipment point. A November 2023 indictment of three individuals in possession of firearms and with conspiracy to distribute; September charges of 42 gang members from the Manati municipality; and many other indictments and arrests of large-scale fentanyl and fentanyl-adjacent operations that drive other violent criminal activity are just a few of the cases that underscore Puerto Rico’s challenges with fentanyl and other deadly drugs.\n\nFinCEN and the Treasury Department are core participants in the President’s National Drug Control Strategy, and we have been leveraging the full range of our tools in service of degrading and disrupting transnational criminal organizations that traffic these dangerous substances. Internal to Treasury alone, we have redoubled our efforts with key partners like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) under the auspices of a newly announced Fentanyl Strike Force. More broadly, we have pursued a series of FinCEN Exchange events around the country, including the one we hosted here yesterday, to bring law enforcement agencies and financial institutions together to share typologies and approaches and build a collectively more nuanced understanding.\n\nWe continue to urge financial institutions to monitor for and report on suspicious activity related to the trafficking of fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and other synthetic opioids, including on the basis of our 2019 advisory on the subject, which remains timely. We are also looking closely at new typologies, trends, and red flag indicators associated with this activity, and will seek to publish any new actionable information as rapidly as possible.\n\nDriving Compliance through Enforcement\n\nEnforcement has long been a critical component of FinCEN’s mission. People who follow the enforcement space have noticed FinCEN becoming increasingly active in this space. This is consistent with recent efforts across various workstreams to increase enforcement by strategically deploying our resources. A significant component of such efforts is FinCEN’s commitment to implementing, and realizing the full potential of, its new Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Whistleblower Program.\n\nThis program holds tremendous potential as an enforcement force-multiplier. Whistleblowers have submitted information relating to some of the most pressing policy objectives of the United States, from Iran- and Russia-related sanctions evasion to drug-trafficking to cyber-crimes and corruption. While efforts are underway to develop an online tip intake portal and other aspects of this important program, I want to note that even while these efforts are underway, the program is actively receiving, reviewing, and sharing tips with our enforcement partners. To date, we have received over 240 unique tips since the program’s inception, and many of the tips received have been highly relevant to many of Treasury’s top priorities. Whistleblowers who voluntarily submit original information to FinCEN about certain violations of the BSA or economic sanctions could be awarded between 10 to 30 percent of penalties collected if their information leads to successful enforcement actions.\n\nI want to conclude today by speaking to how FinCEN is promoting further compliance, particularly in non-“traditional” sectors, by taking a firm approach to enforcement, including here in Puerto Rico. Let me recap a few of our recent cases and some of the related lessons that industry should take away from them.\n\nKingdom Trust Company\n\nIn April of last year, FinCEN imposed a $1.5 million civil money penalty against the Kingdom Trust Company for willful failure to file SARs. Notably, Kingdom Trust was FinCEN’s first action against a trust company. But we saw similar themes to other actions: Kingdom Trust did not grow its compliance program in real-time, and to a level that was commensurate with the elevated risks associated with an expansion of its business. Kingdom Trust’s failures led to unreported suspicious activity related to a trade-based money laundering scheme that was ultimately the subject of a criminal indictment, as well as multiple securities fraud schemes that were the subject of both civil and criminal actions.\n\nBinance\n\nIn November, FinCEN brought a landmark $3.4 billion enforcement action against Binance, the world’s largest virtual asset service provider. FinCEN’s enforcement action against Binance is the largest in Treasury’s history, and was a truly collaborative effort with Treasury counterparts at OFAC and CI as well as our partners at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. FinCEN’s penalties reflect the breadth and significance of Binance’s BSA violations, which included:\n\nFailing to Register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business (MSB): Binance claimed to have exited the U.S. market years ago, but actually did not, retaining U.S. users and other significant ties with the United States.\n\nFailure to Develop, Implement, and Maintain an Effective AML Program: Binance initially failed to develop an AML program, and its subsequent program contained critical gaps that included failing to conduct Know Your Customer processes on large swaths of its users, a lack of risk-based procedures for various offerings, and instructing staff to withhold information from law enforcement.\n\nFailure to Report Suspicious Transactions: Binance’s lack of AML controls allowed illicit actors to transact freely, supporting activities from child sexual abuse, to illegal narcotics, to terrorism, across more than 100,000 transactions. That includes transactions associated with terrorist groups like Hamas’s Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Al Qaeda, and ISIS. Binance processed these transactions, but it never filed a single SAR with FinCEN.\n\nIn addition to the historic penalty, the resolution requires Binance to undertake substantial compliance enhancements that will be overseen through a five-year monitorship (the first of its kind overseeing a virtual asset service provider like Binance). These compliance undertakings are also reinforced through a suspended penalty, which would be collected if Binance fails to comply.\n\nFinCEN’s resolution with Binance, along with those of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, DOJ, and OFAC, recognize the role that cryptocurrency companies play in our financial system. As with financial institutions that offer services in fiat currency, willful evasions of U.S. law will be subject to severe repercussions and remediation of the relevant conduct.\n\nBancredito International Bank and Trust Corporation\n\nIn September, in one of my first acts as Director, FinCEN took a first-of-its kind action against an International Banking Entity, or IBE, here in Puerto Rico. Bancredito International Bank and Trust Corporation, also known as Bancredito, was assessed a $15 million civil money penalty for willful violations of the BSA and its implementing regulations. Bancredito processed millions of dollars in suspicious transactions through the United States on behalf of high-risk customers. On top of its failures to file SARs, Bancredito ignored violations cited by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, or OCIF, did not have an adequate due diligence program for correspondent accounts with foreign financial institutions, and failed to implement an AML program altogether as is now required pursuant to FinCEN regulation. This action should encourage industry to incorporate feedback and findings from their primary regulator on BSA violations. Here, Bancredito failed to address repeated violations cited by OCIF despite ample opportunity to do so.\n\nThis was FinCEN’s first enforcement action for willful failure to design and implement an AML program against a bank without a Federal functional regulator. Bancredito’s willful actions not only put the U.S. financial system at risk, its lack of controls and reporting deprived law enforcement of potentially critical information necessary to disrupt illicit activity.\n\nOCIF and FinCEN collaborated closely on this case, and we are deeply grateful for the partnership we have built. In bringing this action, we sent a very clear message: the era of “easy” money laundering through Puerto Rican IBEs is over. All financial institutions subject to the BSA must fulfill their obligations or face appropriate enforcement action, regardless of the means through which they are chartered or licensed. OCIF and FinCEN are committed to ongoing and robust collaboration in this space, and will not hesitate to take further action to hold financial institutions accountable for BSA failures.\n\nAsre\n\nAnd lastly, FinCEN’s most recent enforcement action was against an individual, Gyanendra Kumar Azre. Asre both served as the BSA Officer of a New York credit union and had his own MSB that he failed to register with FinCEN.\n\nDuring his tenure as BSA Officer, the credit union’s risk profile drastically increased, including by providing services to Asre’s unregistered MSB. Despite these elevated risks, Asre failed to implement adequate AML controls. As a result, hundreds of millions of dollars in high-risk and suspicious funds—including substantial bulk cash deposits—moved through the credit union without proper monitoring or reporting to FinCEN.\n\nIn addition to imposing a penalty on Asre, FinCEN’s action also imposes a five-year ban on Asre’s participation in the conduct of the affairs of a BSA-regulated financial institution. This was FinCEN’s first enforcement action against an individual for their conduct while affiliated with a credit union, and it demonstrates that FinCEN will not hesitate to take action against individuals when their conduct jeopardizes the integrity of our financial system.\n\nAll of these actions constitute considerable progress in addressing a risky sector for money laundering.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’d like to conclude by reiterating that FinCEN looks forward to continuing to partner with the authorities and private industry here in Puerto Rico. I’ve shared today the many ways that FinCEN—along with you as our partners—are working to protect the financial system from harm. We continue to implement the CTA. We are proposing important new rules to bring transparency to the residential real estate and investment adviser industry. And yes, we sometimes have to use our enforcement authorities as a way to safeguard our financial system and send messages about deterrence to non-compliant financial institutions. However, at its core, our nation’s AML framework relies on effective actions not just by FinCEN but also by financial institutions in their role as gatekeepers. That’s why we enjoy taking the opportunity to participate in events like this one, which are attended by compliance professionals who are dedicated to furthering the purposes of the BSA. The more we engage with one another, the more we learn from each other, and that places us in a much better position to protect our financial system from harm. FinCEN, along with our law enforcement partners, will continue to promote justice for those who seek to harm lives and livelihoods and we will promote our shared security. To that end, I hope that this visit is the first of many.\n\nThank you again for your time today; with that, I am happy to take a few questions.\n\n###"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:45:00.649677"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2481]]

know that the new beneficial ownership information reporting rule has been getting the headlines lately.  I will spend some time today talking about that, for sure, but it’s important to note that the information we’ll get from that rule will add value on top of your incredibly important programs and existing reporting. \n\nThe SAR reporting—and other reports—that financial institutions file with FinCEN are critical for law enforcement to find tips and leads that lead to investigations—and prosecutions.  \n\nWe at Treasury have worked for years—long before finalizing the new beneficial ownership rule—to learn about bad actors that hide behind shell and front companies, that abuse our financial system, and that harm American businesses and the American taxpayer.  \n\nUltimately, just like most transactions that are legitimate, we all know that most companies are legitimate businesses.  That’s why your SAR reporting has been and will continue to be critical tools, in addition to beneficial ownership information, to identify the real owners behind companies that are suspected of illicit activity—and will continue to help us link shell companies and front companies to illicit activity. \n\nRecently, we and the rest of TFI have seen how Russian oligarchs use shell companies to hide assets and evade U.S. sanctions.\n\nWe have also seen bad actors using shell companies to fraudulently apply for assistance under various Federal assistance programs—the Paycheck Protection Program, child nutrition programs, and others—that have cost the American taxpayer and hurt those that need help.\n\nForeign governments and drug traffickers alike use anonymous shell and front companies to conduct illicit activity.  And they undermine national security and confidence in our financial system.\n\nFor example, we started the real estate Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) program in 2016 to find the real owners behind all-cash residential purchases in a number of jurisdictions.  That reporting has been invaluable to law enforcement in linking illicit activities to efforts to launder the proceeds of crime. \n\nThe final rule is a significant step forward in our efforts to support law enforcement and national security efforts to stop illicit activity, and will be a valuable additional to our existing tools to counter illicit finance. \n\nIt is the culmination of not only years of hard work at Treasury, but years of bipartisan efforts by Congress, the law enforcement community, national security agencies, and other stakeholders to bolster the United States’ corporate transparency framework.\n\nWe think that it will play an important role in protecting American taxpayers and businesses who play by the rules, but are hurt by criminals that use companies for illegal reasons.  \n\nBefore we get to the discussion, I would like to just briefly highlight these efforts in a little more detail.\n\nThe beneficial ownership information reporting rule is the first of three rulemakings to implement the CTA.  This rule goes into effect on January 1, 2024.\n\nThe second is the Access rule, which will lay out the protocols for access to the beneficial ownership database by law enforcement—at the Federal, state, local, and tribal levels—and by financial institutions.  We are working very hard on this NPRM right how—and we are working to issue it in the near term.\n\nThird, we will be revising the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rule no later than one year after the effective date of the reporting rule—as required by the CTA.\n\nIn parallel with the rulemaking effort, FinCEN is developing the infrastructure to build a secure and confidential database that meets the highest security standards, and that ensures that only authorized users can access the information for authorized purposes.  Security and confidentiality are incredibly important—to us and it’s required by the Corporate Transparency Act.  \n\nWe expect the system to be operational by the time the reporting rule comes into effect. \n\nOur tech teams meet regularly with our policy teams to methodically work through the interplay between the regulations and the tech build.  \n\nWe have gathered initial requirements and are completing system engineering, architecture, and program planning.  The initial build of the cloud infrastructure and development environments are in progress.  \n\nIt’s a challenging process that’s hugely resource-intensive, and I’m proud of the progress that we’ve made so far, because standing up this regulatory regime and the accompanying database will truly be transformative.\n\n \n\nReporting Rule\n\nI want to dig a little more deeply into the substance of the Reporting Rule. \n\nAs I mentioned, at a high level, the rule describes who must file a BOI report, what information must be reported, and when a report is due.  \n\nWhen the rule goes into effect in 2024, those companies that are “reporting companies” will have to disclose information to FinCEN about their beneficial owners and the persons that formed them—that is, the real people who actually own, control, or that created the companies.  \n\nWe know the reporting rule will impact small businesses, as well as financial institutions and Federal and state law enforcement that use the reporting information.  \n\nSo it was critically important that we make every effort to get it right.  Our first step was to issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in April 2021, followed by a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in December 2021, which received over 240 comments.  We considered each of these comments carefully—and the final rule describes in detail our efforts to do so.\n\nFinCEN is mindful of the burden that the rule will place on small businesses.  We made every effort to put forward a final rule that is consistent with the goals that Congress set forth in the CTA, that is, to develop a database that is highly useful to law enforcement, while at the same time, minimizing the burden on businesses.  \n\nBy now you may have had a chance to digest the main parts of the rule, but I’d like to provide a brief overview of some key provisions.\n\nImportantly, and as I’ve mentioned, the effective date for the rule is January 1, 2024.\n\nReporting companies created or registered before the effective date will have one year to file their initial reports and reporting companies created or registered after the effective date will have 30 days after receiving notice of their creation or registration to file their initial reports.\n\nWhat do they have to report?  The rule requires a reporting company to identify itself and report four pieces of information about each of its beneficial owners and company applicants: the name, birthdate, address, and the identifying number and the issuing jurisdiction of an acceptable identification document (as well as an image of such document). \n\nThe rule defines who qualifies as a beneficial owner—it is any individual who, directly or indirectly, either exercises substantial control over a reporting company, or owns or controls at least 25 percent of the ownership interests of a reporting company. \n\nIn defining the contours of who has substantial control, the rule describes a range of activities that could constitute “substantial control” of a company.  This list captures anyone who is able to make important decisions on behalf of the entity, including its senior officers.\n\nThe definition of “ownership interests” covers the wide range of interests through which individuals may own a company—equity, stocks, and contingent interests, among other things.  We have included a catch-all provision to avoid evasion.\n\nThese terms have been drafted to account for the various ownership or control structures that reporting companies may adopt and to close loopholes that allow corporate structuring that obscures owners or decision-makers.\n\nBut we also think that they are structured in a way that will make it relatively straightforward for the majority of small businesses with a simple ownership structure to file and update reports.  \n\nFinCEN estimates that it will cost reporting companies with such simple structures approximately $85 apiece to prepare and submit an initial report in the first year.  In comparison, the state formation fee for creating a limited liability company could cost between $40 and $500, depending on the state.  \n\nWhile issuing the rule was a critical step, implementation will be even more important.  We have a great deal of work to do before January 1, 2024.  \n\nWe will be working to develop guidance and educational materials to help reporting companies prepare to file their beneficial ownership information reports.  \n\nWe will conduct extensive outreach to our stakeholders and partners—for example, to Secretaries of State and small businesses—to help educate reporting companies about their obligations.  \n\nWe have also developed, and will regularly update, a page on FinCEN’s website dedicated to beneficial ownership reporting requirements.\n\nFinally, FinCEN has a call center that businesses can reach out to by phone or email to ask questions: we anticipate building up the hotline’s capacity as we get additional funding. \n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nBeyond the CTA, we are working incredibly hard to meet all of our obligations under the AML Act, and are aligning our priorities and resources—making trade-offs where we need to—to get the job done.  \n\nWe appreciate all of the support that Congress has provided for FinCEN’s mission and for our budget, and we continue to work constructively with Congress on our FY 2023 budget request.  These funds are critical to FinCEN’s success in meeting the new AML Act requirements while still delivering on all elements of our broader mission. \n\nThere is a tremendous amount of work going on outside the beneficial ownership rules that strengthens our national security and the integrity of our financial system, including on Russia, ransomware, virtual currencies, and other AML Act deliverables.\n\nIn fact, Under Secretary Nelson yesterday noted that FinCEN and OFAC announced separate enforcement actions against the U.S. virtual currency exchange Bittrex—marking the first time that FinCEN and OFAC have announced parallel civil enforcement actions.  \n\nThese enforcement actions are consistent with our longstanding stance on responsible innovation.  Regardless of the industry, companies need to implement compliance programs commensurate with the risks of their business and need to grow their compliance programs in real-time.  Responsible innovation means not prioritizing growth over compliance.\n\nI look forward to discussing some of our additional areas of focus with Kieran in the time remaining.  \n\n###"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:45:02.418013"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2482]]

I very much appreciate SIFMA’s invitation to be a part of today’s discussion. I had the opportunity to speak with SIFMA’s AML Committee earlier this year, and I valued that dialogue and your insights. The perspectives of your industry are incredibly important, particularly given our current priorities.\n\nIt is an extremely busy time at FinCEN, so, in our time today, I would like to provide an update on our recent efforts to promote additional transparency in the U.S. financial system; strengthen the U.S. anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, or AML/CFT, system to align with international standards; and advance the U.S. strategy on countering corruption. Specifically, I’ll address our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for investment advisers, provide an update on FinCEN’s efforts to implement the Corporate Transparency Act, and discuss the value of the information that your industry provides to FinCEN and law enforcement, among a few other areas of focus.\n\n \n\nInvestment Advisers NPRM\n\nAs you know, FinCEN issued a proposed rule in February that would require certain investment advisers to implement risk-based AML/CFT programs, report suspicious activity to FinCEN, and fulfill other recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\n\nThe investment adviser sector is a key entry point to the U.S. financial system, facilitating the investment of tens of trillions of dollars by individuals, corporations, and retirement plans, among others. Yet investment advisers are not subject to comprehensive AML/CFT regulations in the United States.\n\nWe have observed how unscrupulous actors have exploited this sector to access the U.S. financial system for nefarious purposes. We’ve identified instances in which corrupt officials, tax evaders, other criminals, and sanctioned individuals have gained access to U.S. securities, real estate, and other assets through investment advisers.\n\nThese are not new risks. In 2003 and 2015, Treasury proposed applying AML requirements to investment advisers, but those proposed rules were never finalized. Since 2015, the sector has almost doubled in assets under management, and we have developed an increasingly detailed understanding of the illicit finance and national security risks associated with this sector.\n\nRight now, there is a patchwork of regulatory coverage in the investment adviser sector. Certain advisers implement some AML measures because they are dually registered as broker dealers, are affiliated with banks or bank subsidiaries, or are part of a financial holding company already subject to these requirements.\n\nThese gaps in regulation allow illicit investors to “shop around” for an adviser who does not need to inquire into their source of wealth. It also creates an unfair playing field in the sector, as different advisers are required to play by different rules.\n\nAlongside the proposed rule, Treasury published a risk assessment specific to the investment adviser sector, which I hope you will find useful. The risk assessment identified several cases where current or former investment advisers laundered illicit proceeds for corrupt foreign officials, fraudsters, and tax evaders.\n\nA FinCEN review of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting identified several venture capital funds serving as an entry point into the U.S. financial system for Russian oligarchs, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has several ongoing investigations of sanctions evasion through U.S. venture capital and private funds.\n\nWe also identified the extent to which investment advisers and their advised funds, particularly venture capital funds, are being used by foreign states, most notably China and Russia, to access certain technology and services with long-term national security implications through investments in early-stage companies. An analysis of BSA reporting identified several U.S. venture capital firms with significant ties to Russian oligarchs that invested in firms developing emerging technologies with national security applications.\n\nThe risk assessment also noted that the highest risk in the investment adviser sector was among exempt reporting advisers, followed by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-registered investment advisers, and then followed by registered investment advisers that are not dually registered as, or affiliated with, a broker-dealer or a bank.\n\nOur current proposal aims to address these risks. We worked hard to tailor the proposal to address national security and illicit finance concerns, while minimizing potential burden on U.S. businesses. We designed the proposed rule to be risk-based, such that smaller advisers may adopt tailored policies and procedures that are consistent with their (often) simpler, more centralized organizational structures.\n\nThe proposed rule would also bring the United States into conformity with international standards and address a significant gap in our AML/CFT system identified in the 2016 U.S. mutual evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international standard-setter for fighting financial crime. The next FATF mutual evaluation of the United States is fast approaching in 2026, and it is important that we move quickly to address this deficiency and remain a global leader in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\n \n\nResidential Real Estate\n\nWhile I am on the subject of proposed rules, our attention is not only on the investment adviser sector. At a time when residential real estate is more expensive than ever and some of our biggest cities are experiencing affordable housing crises, money launderers are exploiting the U.S. housing market and buying homes anonymously to wash their illicitly gained funds. Left unchecked, real estate money laundering can distort housing market prices and make it even more difficult for the average American to afford a home. FinCEN published a notice of proposed rulemaking in February to bring greater transparency to the residential real estate sector that, if finalized, would increase transparency and combat and deter money laundering in the U.S. housing market.\n\nWe are also considering next steps with regard to addressing the illicit finance risks associated with the U.S. commercial real estate sector.\n\nThe public comments for both the investment adviser and residential real estate proposed rules were robust. We received hundreds of comments, which are under thorough review, and Treasury officials had the opportunity to engage directly with a range of advocacy groups during a series of roundtables on both topics.\n\nUltimately, hearing a variety of perspectives leads to strong, practical, and effective regulations, and we’re looking forward to continuing the rulemaking process to better protect U.S. economic and national security.\n\n \n\nCorporate Transparency Act\n\nAnother significant priority for FinCEN in our anti-corruption and AML/CFT modernization efforts is our implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act, which requires certain companies doing business in the United States to report their beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. Those requirements went into effect on January 1, 2024, and are commanding a great deal of our attention.\n\nIn designing the reporting framework, we worked hard to minimize potential burden on the companies required to report. Filing with FinCEN is simple, secure, and free, and for companies with simple ownership structures, it may only take about 20 minutes. We’ve already received more than 1.7 million beneficial ownership information reports and are working tirelessly to get the word out to small businesses and their networks.\n\nWe’re working hard to meet small business owners where they are—by partnering with agencies like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Small Business Administration; publishing multimedia guidance and answers to frequently asked questions, collaborating with secretaries of state; educating trusted service providers like accountants and registered agents; reaching members of trade and industry associations; participating in both in-person and virtual events; and beginning a paid media campaign that encompasses digital, print, radio, streaming, and TV. We’re fully committed to ensuring that the filed reports yield a useful database to fulfill the law enforcement and national security purposes laid out in the Corporate Transparency Act.\n\nWe are working toward a phased approach to providing access to beneficial ownership information. The first stage will be a pilot program for a handful of key Federal agency users that we expect to begin very soon. The second stage will extend access to Treasury offices and certain Federal agencies engaged in law enforcement and national security activities that already have Memoranda of Understanding for access to BSA information.\n\nSubsequent stages will extend access to additional Federal agencies engaged in law enforcement, national security, and intelligence activities, as well as to State, local, and Tribal law enforcement partners; to intermediary Federal agencies in connection with foreign government requests; and finally, to financial institutions and their supervisors. We expect that financial institutions subject to customer due diligence obligations will receive access in Spring 2025.\n\n \n\nAML Act Implementation\n\nBeyond these anti-corruption and transparency efforts, we remain focused on our implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (or, the AML Act). The AML Act included transformational changes to FinCEN’s core authorities, with the overall goal of strengthening, modernizing, and streamlining the existing AML regime by promoting innovation, regulatory reform, and industry and stakeholder engagement.\n\nWe recognize the importance of full implementation of the AML Act to make the framework more effective and risk-based. The issuance of an updated AML program rule is a foundational part of this effort, and we intend to issue a proposed rule this year that includes regulatory amendments that would ensure that AML/CFT programs incorporate the National AML/CFT Priorities, and are effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed.\n\nWhen we issued the Priorities in June 2021, we encouraged financial institutions to assess their risk exposure to those Priorities while we work on implementing regulations. We recognize that financial institutions have been anxiously waiting for a proposed rule to see how they will be required or expected to incorporate the Priorities into their AML/CFT programs.\n\nWe view revising the AML/CFT program rule consistently with the AML Act to be a substantial step in a multi-year and multi-step effort to transition to a more effective and risk-based AML/CFT framework.\n\n \n\nRussia\n\nIn addition to these efforts, FinCEN continues its work across our broad and growing mandate to support law enforcement and national security agencies. First, we are prioritizing the targeting of Russian money laundering and sanctions and export control evasion activities.\n\nIn response to Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, FinCEN published numerous Alerts to help financial institutions further identify and report suspicious transactions related to potential Russia-related money laundering, and sanctions and export control evasion activities. And we have been analyzing BSA reports filed in response to these Alerts to identify trends and patterns. In September of 2023, FinCEN published a Financial Trend Analysis summarizing some of the findings of that analysis as it relates to BSA reporting related to Russia-related export control evasion. The Alerts and the Financial Trend Analysis are available on our website.\n\nDrawing from that reporting, FinCEN has also been able to conduct and contribute to investigations involving: Russia-related sanctions evasion; violations of the price cap on Russian oil exports; trust and company service providers that obfuscate the wealth of Russian elites; and entities that export dual use technology to Russia’s defense sector, the precious metals sector, and Russian private military companies.\n\nYour reporting is providing us with visibility into the financial networks of Russian proliferators, shell companies, fronts, and other professional enablers—leading to new investigations and bolstered existing investigations. These efforts have led to law enforcement actions and civil and administrative actions against a variety of illicit actors. Further, we have partnered particularly closely with OFAC and the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which both use BSA data in targeting and enforcement work, and tell us that BSA reports have furthered their ability to leverage their authorities and further disrupt organizations attempting to circumvent Russia-related sanctions.\n\nCountering Russian illicit finance, sanctions and export control evasion, and supporting the U.S. Government’s efforts in response to the ongoing war, remain priorities for FinCEN and the Department of the Treasury, and we will continue to evaluate how our tools and authorities can best be utilized in those efforts.\n\n \n\nTerrorist Financing\n\nI also want to spend a few moments discussing our efforts to help financial institutions detect, prevent, and report suspicious activity that may be tied to the financing of Hamas and its revenue streams around the world, including entities located in third countries that may be abetting Hamas’s fundraising machinations.\n\nThe attacks by Hamas against Israel on October 7, 2023, were horrific and only underscored the importance of countering terrorist financing as a core mission of Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, including FinCEN.\n\nShortly after the attack, FinCEN issued an alert containing red flags that FinCEN identified to help financial institutions identify and report suspicious activity connected to funding streams supporting Hamas. Hamas’s revenue streams include—or have traditionally included— support from Iran; private donations; a global portfolio of investments; the control of border crossings and avenues of commerce; racketeering business frameworks; extortionary practices around local populations; and fundraising campaigns involving virtual currency and sham charities raising both fiat and virtual currency. Some of those streams have been impacted by the war in Gaza, which Hamas has de facto controlled since 2007.\n\nAs a result of this Alert, FinCEN has received over 200 BSA filings. Filers have reported suspicious transactions involving suspected sham charities, potential online fundraising using social media and cryptocurrencies, the purchase of weapons and tactical gear destined for the Middle East, and the use of likely shell companies to obscure the purpose of financial activities.\n\nFinCEN is actively analyzing this information and collaborating with law enforcement and other partners to support investigations and actions to disrupt these terrorist financing networks. Please know that reporting coming in as a result of the Alert will be incredibly valuable to the whole-of-government efforts to deny Hamas the ability to raise funds worldwide for its terrorist activities.\n\n \n\nEnforcement and Compliance Efforts\n\nI would now like to turn to some of FinCEN’s more recent enforcement and compliance-related work, which has long been a critical component of FinCEN’s mission. Those who follow the enforcement space have likely noticed FinCEN becoming increasingly active on these issues, which is consistent with our efforts across various workstreams to increase enforcement by strategically deploying our resources. A significant component of such efforts is FinCEN’s commitment to implementing, and realizing the full potential of, its new Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Whistleblower Program.\n\nThis program holds tremendous potential as an enforcement force-multiplier. Whistleblowers have submitted information relating to some of the most pressing policy objectives of the United States, from Iran- and Russia-related sanctions evasion to drug-trafficking to cyber-crimes and corruption. While efforts are underway to develop an online tip intake portal and other aspects of this important program, I want to note that even while these efforts are underway, the program is actively receiving, reviewing, and sharing tips with our enforcement partners.\n\nWe have received over 270 unique tips since the program’s inception, and many of the tips received have been highly relevant to many of Treasury’s top priorities. Whistleblowers who voluntarily submit original information to FinCEN about certain violations of the BSA or economic sanctions could be awarded between 10 to 30 percent of penalties collected if their information leads to successful enforcement actions.\n\nI do also want to highlight an action that FinCEN took last November, when FinCEN imposed a landmark $3.4 billion civil money penalty against Binance, the world’s largest virtual asset provider. FinCEN’s penalties reflect the breadth and significance of Binance’s BSA violations, which included:\n\nFailing to Register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business (MSB): Binance claimed to have exited the U.S. market years ago, but did not actually do so, retaining U.S. users and other significant ties with the United States.\n\nFailure to Develop, Implement, and Maintain an Effective AML Program: Binance initially failed to develop an AML program, and its subsequent program contained critical gaps that included failing to conduct Know Your Customer processes on large swaths of its users, a lack of risk-based procedures for various offerings, and instructing staff to withhold information from law enforcement.\n\nFailure to Report Suspicious Transactions: Binance’s lack of AML controls allowed illicit actors to transact freely, supporting activities from child sexual abuse, to illegal narcotics, to terrorism, across more than 100,000 transactions. That includes transactions associated with terrorist groups like Hamas’s Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Al Qaeda, and ISIS. Binance processed these transactions, but it never filed a single suspicious activity report (SAR) with FinCEN.\n\nFinCEN’s resolution with Binance, along with those of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and OFAC, recognize the role that cryptocurrency companies play in our financial system. As with financial institutions that offer services in fiat currency, willful evasions of U.S. law will be subject to severe repercussions and remediation of the relevant conduct.\n\n \n\nValue of BSA Data\n\nI would also like to take some time to share a bit more about what we are seeing in SAR filings by your industry, the value of this information to law enforcement, and the importance of information sharing.\n\nFinCEN received nearly 119,000 SARs from securities and futures filers between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2024. This averages almost 5,000 SARs a month. Automated Clearing House (ACH) fraud, identity theft, wire transfer fraud, check fraud, and suspicious wire transfers were the most frequently reported suspicious activity subtypes.\n\nOf the top 15 suspicious activity subtypes, the largest percentage increases in reporting from the prior year were for embezzlement, theft, or disappearance of funds—which saw a 34 percent increase—and elder financial exploitation, which increased 63 percent.\n\nActivities most frequently reported in the “other” free text field included “free riding,” new account fraud, and money mule schemes.\n\nSAR information is incredibly valuable to law enforcement and other stakeholder for identifying leads and mapping illicit finance networks. Most SARs filed in this time period referenced fraud and/or some form of money laundering activity. About 17 percent mentioned cyber-related terms and about 90 SARs referenced terms related to fentanyl.\n\nIn particular, I would like to highlight an investigation that was successful due, in part, to SAR reporting by several broker dealers. This case was the recipient of a FinCEN Law Enforcement Award last year. In this case, the IRS, Criminal Investigation; Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General investigated a massive pandemic relief fraud ring that operated at the height of the COVID‐19 pandemic.\n\nThe investigation began shortly after the Attorney General’s creation of the COVID‐19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force. The team was originally tasked with investigating 10 loans made under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020. Investigators quickly used the information found in BSA filings to identify additional fraud and linked the initial list of 10 loans to more than 150 loans totaling approximately $21 million in fraud.\n\nBecause the defendants used fictitious identities and a vast network of bank accounts to commit the fraud and launder the proceeds, investigators also used the public-private information-sharing program FinCEN administers pursuant to section 314(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act to identify additional bank accounts for their investigation. The 314(a) program responses led investigators to additional fraud schemes and, combined with traditional law enforcement tactics, eventually led investigators to the true identity of the culprits. BSA filings were also essential in identifying relationships between co-defendants. Prior to their sentencing, the main defendants fled the United States and became international fugitives.\n\nAgain, investigators used BSA data—including SARs filed by broker dealers—to sniff out the financial trail. Investigators were able to run queries through FinCEN’s databases and identify accounts that the suspects opened at cryptocurrency exchanges using the same fictitious identities that were used to perpetrate the original fraud. Investigators also discovered that the defendants were applying for additional loans post‐indictment and even during trial.\n\nEventually, the financial trail led investigators to discover the whereabouts of the fugitives. International cooperation resulted in extradition of the defendants. All eight defendants have been sentenced, with the ringleaders receiving sentences of 17 years and nearly 11 years. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, and the DOJ Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecuted this case.\n\n \n\nSAR Tips and Information Sharing\n\nSo again, thank you to those broker dealers who helped the investigators piece together and successfully prosecute this case.\n\nGiven the high-value of this reporting, I would like to also share some value-creating practices that FinCEN has found increases the value and utility of a financial institution’s SARs.\n\nFirst: Include a “bottom-line-up-front” paragraph at the beginning of each SAR narrative. Clearly identify and explain why the activity is suspicious within the first paragraph of the narrative. This helps law enforcement quickly understand the potential importance and scope of the reported activity and triage its further review and analysis.\n\nSecond: Include a citation to – or clear explanation of – the source of any external information triggering the determination that the activity was suspicious. For example, if the triggering event is a press report highlighting a connection to an OFAC sanctioned entity or person, provide a citation to the press report. Or, if the triggering event is consistency with red flags from a FinCEN Alert related to Russia, reference the alert and include the requested keyword in Field 2 and the Narrative. This helps law enforcement understand the full context and identify potential relevance or links to other data sources.\n\nThird: Identify any links to foreign countries, including, for instance, IP addresses. Identifying such links gives FinCEN, as the financial intelligence unit (FIU) for the United States, the opportunity to collaborate with FIUs in other countries, as well as their law enforcement and government partners.\n\n314(b) Program\n\nI do have one last best practice I would like to share, which is really more of a plug for information sharing through our 314(b) program.\n\nI was very encouraged to learn that we currently have approximately 1,700 securities firms already registered to share information under section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act. This comprises over 20 percent of all registered financial institutions and is second only to depository institutions. So, thank you to those who are already registered and actively sharing information under this program.\n\nFor those of you who may not be a part of the program, we strongly encourage you to participate and look for opportunities to form associations to engage in voluntary information sharing. And for those already registered, I encourage you to continue to use, and potentially expand, existing processes to collect and share information in furtherance of investigations that involve cross-border activity.\n\nFinCEN truly views information sharing as one of the most powerful tools to help enhance compliance with AML/CFT requirements.\n\nOne of the most valuable uses of 314(b) information sharing is alerting other participating financial institutions to customers whose suspicious activities they may not have been previously aware. Relatedly, 314(b) information sharing facilitates the filing of more comprehensive SARs than would otherwise be filed.\n\nIn cases where a financial institution files a SAR that has benefited from section 314(b) information sharing, FinCEN encourages financial institutions to note this in the narrative. Doing so not only provides useful context for law enforcement, it also helps FinCEN identify and communicate specific examples of the benefits of the section 314(b) program.\n\nTo that end, FinCEN updated its SAR User Guide in August 2021 to request financial institutions include the sentence “This SAR contains 314(b) data.” in the narrative for such cases. The most up-to-date version of this user guide can always be found on our BSA E-Filing website.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nI know I have covered quite a bit of ground today in our time together, but I believe it speaks to the broad scope of FinCEN’s mission and the range of functions that FinCEN performs as we work to address the various illicit finance threats facing our country. In some ways, I feel like I just scratched the surface, and to that end, you will be hearing more from my FinCEN colleagues today on both the enforcement and CTA panels.\n\nThank you again and enjoy the rest of the conference.\n\n###"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:45:05.234598"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2483]]

This represents the first time annual cigarette sales have increased in 20 years.\n\nAccording to the 2020 Smokeless Tobacco Report, smokeless tobacco sales increased from 126.0 million pounds in 2019 to 126.9 million pounds in 2020. The revenue from those sales rose from $4.53 billion in 2019 to $4.82 billion in 2020. For the first time, the Commission is reporting sales of nicotine lozenges or nicotine pouches not containing tobacco. In 2020, the companies sold 140.7 million units of such products in the United States, for $420.5 million.\n\nThe amount spent on cigarette advertising and promotion increased from $7.62 billion in 2019 to $7.84 billion in 2020. Price discounts paid to cigarette retailers ($6.07 billion) and wholesalers ($876 million) were the two largest expenditure categories in 2020. Combined spending on price discounts accounted for 88.5 percent of industry spending.\n\nSpending on advertising and promotion by the major manufacturers of smokeless tobacco products in the U.S. decreased from $576.1 million in 2019 to $567.3 million in 2020. As with cigarettes, price discounts made up the two largest spending categories, with $296.6 million paid to retailers and $83.5 million paid to wholesalers. Combined spending on price discounts totaled $380.1 million – or 67.4 percent of all spending in 2020, up from the $376.0 million spent in 2019.\n\nFor the first time, the 2020 data include information on the flavors of the companies’ smokeless tobacco products. Menthol flavored smokeless tobacco products comprised more than half of all sales revenues (54.5 percent); tobacco flavored products (that is, no added flavor) comprised 43.4 percent; and fruit flavored smokeless tobacco products comprised 2.5 percent.\n\nThe Commission has issued the Cigarette Report periodically since 1967 and the Smokeless Tobacco Report periodically since 1987. Given the concerning trends highlighted in this report, including the first increase in cigarette sales in two decades, the Commission will continue to expand its approach in reporting shifts in the tobacco industry. The FTC also will use the newly captured data regarding smokeless tobacco products to align the Commission’s enforcement efforts with the emergent realities in the tobacco industry.\n\nThe Commission vote to issue the reports was 5-0. \n\nThe Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and protect and educate consumers.  The FTC will never demand money, make threats, tell you to transfer money, or promise you a prize.

Virtually every day, parties and their counsel make arguments and present evidence to us regarding the various merger and conduct matters handled by the Bureau’s various Divisions. Some of this advocacy is conducted in person, but much of it takes place on paper, in the memoranda universally known as “white papers.” In some ways, white papers can be even more useful than in-person presentations at 600 Pennsylvania Avenue: they can be read (and re-read) carefully; they can be distributed to a wider group than the handful of attendees at a meeting; and they reduce the risk that your carefully chosen words will be misremembered or misunderstood.\n\nMost written advocacy to the Bureau is of an extremely high quality, reflecting the caliber and experience of the counsel who appear before us.  Nevertheless, sometimes we notice that there’s some room for improvement. To that end, last month I wrote a very short blog post for the Bureau’s Competition Matters blog on the importance of brevity in white papers. And now, I’m writing to share some further thoughts on how to use them effectively. Of course, it’s up to parties and their counsel to decide how to advocate to us: these comments are just intended to give a window into what we find helpful when reading through the work product that we receive daily from parties, complainants, market participants, and others.\n\nA white paper to the Bureau, like any other form of written advocacy, is helpful only insofar as it achieves four basic but crucial objectives. From most important to least important, those objectives are: honesty, clarity, brevity, and timeliness. I’ll say something about each of those in turn.\n\nHonesty. First, in every sense, is honesty. Candor is the single most important measure of written advocacy, and a submission to the Bureau must be scrupulously honest. Of course, this means above all that parties should resist the temptation to shade the facts or the state of the law in ways that will not survive contact with the underlying documents or with fair-minded legal research. As Bruce Hoffman and Heather Johnson have pointed out in another recent blog post, FTC rules prohibit unprofessional conduct in general and misleading representations in particular, on pain of suspension or disbarment from practice before the Commission.\n\nHappily, outright misrepresentations are rare in submissions to the Bureau. But a related problem can arise when advocates ignore bad or difficult facts and focus on what they think will be the more helpful ones. This kind of approach can lead to statements that are literally accurate but are misleading in context, or which totally fail to grapple with a difficult issue. In some recent cases, parties’ submissions have attempted to duck a key issue that they have been expressly asked, by staff or the Bureau, to address. Don’t do this! If there is a tough fact, document, or argument that undermines (or might wrongly be thought to undermine) your position, it’s imperative to acknowledge it in full, right up front, and address it with your best response. Gamesmanship, or ignoring something and hoping for the best, just isn’t worthwhile. Our experienced and hard-working staff know the facts intimately and have access to a wide array of truth-generating mechanisms, including investigational hearings, extensive document productions, and broad contact with other knowledgeable market participants.\n\nSimilar problems can also arise when parties or their counsel make strong representations to staff, or to the Bureau, that turn out not to survive contact with the facts. In many cases, this happens because representatives of parties or counsel got out ahead of their own factual investigation and did not properly vet or fact-check a statement before making it. This is always an unhappy event, but there are two good ways to manage the risk. First, resist the urge to make broad representations before a careful and thorough investigation of the facts: a measured approach is always wiser while investigations are proceeding. Second, if you learn facts that are in some tension with a previous oral or written statement to the Bureau or staff, correct the record immediately and candidly. We understand that these things can happen; but nothing is more harmful to a party’s interests, or to the credibility of their counsel, than leaving the Bureau or staff to find out independently that a party’s representation was not accurate.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that a written submission should not only be literally honest: it should also aim to leave the reader feeling confident that its arguments are a fair reading of the relevant underlying facts or materials. The best way to do this is to include the most important supporting documents—whether ordinary course business documents, expert analysis, testimony, cited documents, or anything else—as attachments to the white paper. If your argument relies on expert analysis, for example, both the analytical work and the underlying data should be attached to the white paper. A bare conclusion with a promise of future expert substantiation will inspire only skepticism. If the expert work is complete, it should be included; if it is not, the submission itself is premature. Of course, there is a balancing exercise to be undertaken when deciding how much to include: all else equal, brevity’s certainly better. But if the reader has to reach out to others in order to rustle up copies of underlying materials to fact-check your arguments—or, worse, if those materials do not yet exist—the persuasiveness of your submission is likely to suffer. And when prioritizing among supporting materials, remember that ordinary course business documents are often more helpful than after-the-fact testimony.\n\nClarity. Clarity is more important than anything except honesty. (For the reasons identified above, resist the temptation to choose the clearer nearly-true version over more complex really-true version: honesty first.) But clarity trumps everything else, including brevity: if you really have to choose between being clear and being brief, be clear. Among other things, this means that you should plainly and succinctly identify what you or your client are asking of us, and why. What is it that we can do, should do, and are not currently doing?\n\nSurprisingly, parties—particularly but not exclusively complainants—sometimes fail to give a straightforward statement of what they want from us. The work of the Bureau is made much easier when complaining parties identify particular conduct that they allege is unlawful and tell us why they think so. Of course, this is not a strict obligation: parties don’t need to seek expensive antitrust counsel in order to bring a concern to our attention, and the FTC’s staff are experienced enough to spot potential grounds of antitrust concern in generalized complaints. But our work is much easier when advocates clearly state the problem they’ve encountered and the solution they’re asking for.\n\nBrevity. After honesty and clarity, brevity is your best friend (and ours). Submissions should be as long as necessary in order to honestly and clearly present the party’s arguments, and not a page longer. It is neither necessary nor helpful to repeat arguments made in previous papers to the Bureau, and aligned parties should make joint submissions wherever possible rather than duplicate one another’s arguments. If your matter raises a variety of discrete issues, consider whether it would be more effective to submit a set of short papers, each dealing with an individual topic, rather than a single omnibus Lord-of-the-Rings-style tome. And, where a single paper genuinely must be longer than you’d like, make sure your table of contents and two- or three-page executive summary are models of elegance and clarity. An executive summary, in particular, should state not only the conclusions that you want the reader to accept but also the principal reasons why those conclusions are appropriate. Don’t hide the crucial arguments in the body of a long paper: an executive summary that includes conclusions without reasoning is a missed opportunity to help the reader.\n\nThe importance of brevity is a function of the volume of document flow to, from, and through the Front Office. We read everything carefully—however long it is—but the chances that a document will be fully digested and discussed in good time is greatest if it is boiled down to its essence by the author first. Recall that the Bureau typically has between 10 and 20 second request investigations ongoing at any given time, plus a wide variety of initial merger reviews and conduct investigations, plus the various policy and other activities that fill up the schedule every day. Each of these matters generates a slew of paperwork from the various Bureaus and Offices at the FTC. Parties and their counsel want the Bureau to spend time thinking carefully about their argument, and talking about it with one another and the staff team, not struggling to get through the submission in good time.\n\nTimeliness. Finally, but indispensably, a submission must be timely: that means it should reach us at least three business days before a meeting or other critical event, and longer if it’s a lengthy document or raises novel issues. As a colleague remarked recently, a last minute white paper just isn’t worth a whole lot: it can’t be read carefully, discussed, analyzed, or effectively tested by staff. Every white paper from a party invariably prompts the Bureau or a Commissioner to ask: “ok, but what does the staff think?” And if the paper has just arrived, the answer is likely to be: “the team just received it and are still working through it.” Advocacy without a reaction from the staff team will be heavily discounted by the reader. This means that attempting to jam the staff or Bureau with eleventh-hour submissions is self-defeating: the best way to persuade us is by following regular order and making arguments that can survive careful analysis and meaningful reflection by the many people who work on the Bureau’s cases.\n\n*\n\nI doubt that there is anything particularly surprising or novel, or even particularly specific to the Bureau, in our desire for honesty, clarity, brevity, and timeliness in written submissions. And, to be sure, none of these is a moral absolute (except honesty, which is): we recognize, for example, that sometimes a white paper will arrive late despite everyone’s best efforts, and we appreciate that it can be hard to achieve both brevity and clarity at the same time in some of our more complex cases.\n\nThese short comments—which could themselves probably have been shorter and clearer—are intended to give some insight on what we generally expect and look for in written submissions, to explain what will help us digest them efficiently, and to help us give fair value to the arguments and evidence they present. To that end, I hope they’ll help you to help us to help you, in our ongoing efforts to ensure that all parties (and their counsel) experience an efficient, fair, and careful process in all the Bureau’s cases.\n\n*The opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Trade Commission or any individual Commissioner.

Harris, and Thomas G. Sacca are operating a pyramid scheme that uses false promises of wealth and income to entice thousands of consumers to join. The FTC alleges that the defendants have taken more than $7 million from consumers, and pocketed over $1.3 million for themselves.\n\nThe FTC alleges that less than 2 percent of participating consumers received more money from the defendants than they paid to them, and that those lucky few averaged less than $250 per month—a far cry from the defendants’ promises of “financial freedom.” After accounting for the costs of the program, products, and events, enrollees lost millions of dollars, the FTC’s filings allege.\n\nThe FTC also alleges that Jay Noland is violating a 2002 court order stemming from a previous FTC case related to another failed pyramid scheme. Shortly before launching Success By Health in 2017, the FTC alleges, Noland told an audience, “People ask what do I do. I said, ‘I build pyramids, man.’”\n\nThe FTC alleges that Success By Health’s flagship product is an instant coffee called “MycoCafe” that includes a mushroom that the defendants claim has health benefits. However, the FTC alleges that selling the product to coffee drinkers took a back seat to recruiting more affiliates. Company training materials allegedly show that affiliates were pressured first and foremost to recruit more affiliates. The company’s “Four Steps to Success” pointedly do not include any advice on selling the company’s product, but instead prioritize spending lots of money on products and recruiting others to “duplicate” the same spending and recruiting.\n\nThe defendants told affiliates that “the masses” could earn more than $1 million each month in sales commissions, the FTC alleges. However, the marketing materials allegedly failed to disclose that to achieve that level of commissions, an affiliate would have to recruit more than 100,000 affiliates working underneath them, the vast majority of whom would be losing money at any given time.\n\nThe complaint alleges that when affiliates did try to sell the product to other consumers, they found themselves in competition with the company itself. Success By Health sells its products directly to the public for the same “wholesale” price paid by affiliates, severely limiting affiliates’ ability to follow the defendants’ instructions to apply a 50 percent “markup” before selling to the public.\n\nThe Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint and contempt order was 5-0. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.\n\nNOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the named defendants are violating or are about to violate the law and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the court.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers.

The Rule also says that prescribers must verify the prescription – or provide it – in response to a request from an authorized third party. With this framework in place, consumers are empowered to comparison shop at a variety of traditional and online retailers for the lenses their healthcare professionals have prescribed, if they choose to do so.\n\nWe’re hosting the workshop in conjunction with the FTC’s regulatory review of the Contact Lens Rule. (A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was issued in December 2016 announcing proposed changes.) So how is the Rule working? To what extent are consumers able to comparison shop under the Rule’s prescription release and verification framework? How have new technologies, including electronic health records, affected the prescription verification process, and what other innovations might be on the horizon? Would any modifications to the Rule foster additional competition and maximize the health and financial benefits to consumers? Are there particular medical or safety issues that should inform discussion of these topics?\n\nTo talk about those questions and more, we’re convening a public workshop on March 7th featuring healthcare professionals, industry members, consumer advocates, law enforcers, and others.\n\nAfter introductory remarks by Thomas Pahl, Acting Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, Panel #1 will offer an overview of the contact lens marketplace. Panel #2 will feature medical professionals sharing insights on the health and safety issues the Rule implicates. The topic on the table for Panel #3 will be competition in the contact lens marketplace. Panel #4 will examine the prescription verification process and Panel #5 will take on issues surrounding prescription release and consumer choice. The last panel of the day will look to the future. Are there potential market disruptors that may have an impact on competition, consumer protection, and the Rule?\n\nThe event is free and open to the public. Registration begins at 7:45 a.m. at the FTC’s Constitution Center Conference Center, 400 7th Street, S.W., in Washington, DC.\n\nCan’t make it to Washington on March 7th? We’ll post a link on the event page just before 9:00 ET that morning so you can watch the webcast live.\n\n \n\nTags:\n\nConsumer Protection\n\nAdvertising and Marketing\n\nHealth Claims\n\nAdvertising and Marketing Basics\n\n      Comments closed.\n\nRegina F Miller\n\nMarch 01, 2018\n\nThe ability to purchase contact lenses at various places and online has greatly impacted my family.  It has made them more affordable and it more convenient to purchase them.\n\nDillon Boynton\n\nApril 02, 2018\n\nMy office gets a call. Its a 10minute recording saying a patients purchased contacts online and I have to sit on the phone and listen to the 10 minute recording and at the end they finally tell me the patient name and contact lens prescription i can verify and if the prescription is wrong i can call and leave a message to the company. Now mulioly that 10 minutes by ten people and it is a very frustrating horrible process. Most internet companies havebno actual person to talk to and probably dont even check the recordings.  But after 10 of these recordings a day. And them putting the info at the end of the recording it is very time consuming and useless as they dont even check to hear the messages i leave.\n\nFrancisco Gonzales\n\nApril 02, 2018\n\nI love ordering my contacts online. I buy one box and it lasts me the whole year and i dont have to pay for an exam. I just keep ordering the same prescription thats on the box.\n\nMichael Simpson\n\nApril 02, 2018\n\nI am a truck driver and love sleeping in my contacts so i can just wake up and get to my destination. I am too busy to get an exam so ordering contacts online is great for me. Once i got a really bad infection when i was out of contacts so i just kept wearing an old lens for about 7 months. But i was able to just order contacts from 1800 contacts without a prescription. for another box and i was good for another 2 years. I do get some glare at night though. And i see a white thing on my pupil. I don't know what that is.\n\nEric Johnson\n\nApril 03, 2018\n\nI only have one eye and eye doctors say i shouldnt wear contacts and sleep in them but i can order them online and they give it to me.\n\nViola Kanevsky\n\nApril 04, 2018\n\nLast week, one of my patients, a 17 year old girl, just learning to drive, came in to the office to ask why her vision had suddenly blurred with her contacts. Her visual acuity, which had been 20/20 with her prescribed torics lenses just weeks ago, was now 20/100. Worried that something was seriously wrong, I asked to check her contact lens boxes and discovered that she was in possession of lenses she had purchased online. These were completely devoid of any astigmatic correction, they were a different material and size than the ones originally prescribed by my. The online retailer was contacted and said, simply, “no worries, we can refund her money.”\nNo verification attempt had been made. No attempt to fill the correct Rx. Blatant disregard for both the health of her eyes as well as the safety of both the young lady and other drivers in the road. \n\nEvery patient leaves my office with a written prescription free to purchase lenses anywhere they choose. Most of my patients are teens. Not many would be savvy enough to know that a substitution had been made which may endanger their eyes and vision. \n\nThis problem is getting worse, despite the current law. Enacting new rules would create an undue burden on my practice without enforcing current rules that hold unlicensed dispensers of medical devices accountable for their illegal behavior. \n\nIt is my sincere hope that instead of adding red tape and more useless rules, the FTC sees fit to simply hold all parties involved accountable and enforce the current rules already in place. \n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDr. Viola Kanevsky\n\nDr. David Girardi\n\nApril 04, 2018\n\nThere is a misconception with that statement and I'll explain why.  Patients think that when they purchase contacts from the doctor's office, they will pay more because either the online places get a better volume discount (which they do to some degree) or there is a higher markup at the office vs online.  A single box price is probably cheaper online but when you get a larger supply, (ie. a year supply) the doctor's office is usually better.  This is due to the shipping costs being free from the manufacturer and availability of rebates from the doctor's office.  Not to mention any additional discounts from the doctor's office for purchasing a years supply that add extra incentive.  For example, we give patients an extra 10% discount for year purchases that they can pick up conveniently at our office, sometimes that day if we have them in stock, or we can have shipped to their house.  At least we know the product is coming straight from the manufacturer where there is a controlled environment so it would be less prone to defects from extreme temperature differences.  \n\nEarlier this week I had an established patient come in for a contact lens exam and expressed some desire to switch from the present brand of contacts she was using.  When I asked what the problem was, she indicated she had liked her daily lenses in the past, but last year she purchased them from 1800 contacts and found that the lenses were blurrier than she remembered them being.  Her eyes felt more tired and dry at the end of the day.  She had brought a pair of the lenses in with her and when I looked at them, they were in the same packaging as I would have expected.  The problem, though is that we don't know how they were stored at the warehouses.  Now I can't say that there is a problem at the warehouses of 1800 contacts. based on this.   However, I haven't had a patient complain about a supply of lenses they received directly from the manufacturer or from our distributor either.  This patient made this complaint as soon as I asked how her contacts were doing and I had no knowledge of how she bought them.  \n\nI hope this letter can add some insight to how doctor's offices try to keep the costs of contact lenses fair to the public. In  In addition, I will always provide a prescription to the patient for their contacts at their offering and without hesitation following education of their options at the conclusionof the exam.\n\nJessica Jones\n\nApril 04, 2018\n\nI have had patients order their lenses online and not received the astigmatism correction that was prescribed. This leaves these individuals with reduced vision that affects them during work, school, driving, and other activities of daily living. They also are not receiving proper wear schedules, insertion and removal training, and hygiene education based on the health of their eyes which put them at risk for blinding conditions that can affect their future employability. Third party vendors are known to take advantage of the verification process involving doctors. They have been known to send rx verifications after hours, weekends, and other non-business hours. They fill expired prescriptions based on the resulting slow responses from the prescriber.\n\nScott Ream O.D.\n\nApril 04, 2018\n\nI am an optometrist. I have no problem giving contact lens prescriptions to patients or companies, what I do have a problem with is these companies changing my prescription without authorization, refilling a prescription year after year without a current prescription or using deceptive practices to obtain an authorization. All of these practices endanger the eye sight of my patients.\n\nKimberly Chen\n\nApril 04, 2018\n\nPlease keep it as medical device.  Without proper education and testing from eye doctors people can order wrong contacts with wrong prescription and getting infections.   It's dangerous to have any device in the eyes with doctor approval.\n\nJames Anglim\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nThe passive contact lens prescription verification process needs to be fixed. This proposed rule is a step in the wrong direction.\n\nBen Konynenbelt\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nI strongly agree with the free market being the most efficient driver for economic growth; however, some of the recommendations for improving competition in the contact lens marketplace appear anti-competitive and dangerous to the contact lens consumer. The recommendation that patients sign a document confirming the receipt of their contact lens prescription from their provider places an excessive administrative burden on the healthcare provider. This added administrative would force independent health care providers to raise their prices making them less competitive. Furthermore, the nature of the document would implicitly cause a distrust of the patient of the doctor, as it would cause the patient to question why the doctor is required to provide such a document. The doctor-patient relationship is key to a working health care system, and it goes without saying that patients need to be able to trust their doctor. Lastly, many online retailers and &quot;market disruptors&quot; have used tactics to avoid verification of prescriptions in order to complete the sale that day. These tactics have led to improper dispensing of medical devices. As vision is imperative to being fully engaged in society, when improper contact lens prescriptions are dispensed, blurred vision can lead to decreased work performance, decreased performance while operating motor vehicles, decreased school performance, and many other unwanted consequences. Likewise, filling expired prescriptions without verification encourages patients to not seek preventative healthcare that is included with the determination of a contact lens prescription. Ocular diseases such as glaucoma may not be managed properly because the contact lens retailer is suggesting a comprehensive eye exam is not necessary to wear contact lenses. Please keep fair competition and consumer health in mind while making your decision on the Contact Lens Rule.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nBen Konynenbelt\n\nJames L Ducklo, O.D.\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nYour mission is to protect the consumer and your policies are contrary to your mission.  I see many of my patients wearing contact lenses that I did not prescribe.  The contact lens verification process is a joke and is a constant burden to my staff. There are many contact lenses that were made in foreign countries that are being diverted to America.  The playing field has been tilted towards the on-line retailers. Your rules supersede state rules and regulations. These guidelines were put in place to protect the consumer.  If you really want to protect the consumer, then enact stiff penalties for diverted product and selling contact lenses on an invalid prescription.  The result from these practices are corneal scarring from infiltrating keratitis secondary to contact lens over wear or hypoxia from lenses like Hubble.  I never fit a lens made from polymacon which is the original contact lens material.  Please stop allowing prescription diversion.\n\nKanela Siskos\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nAs an eye care professional in the field  for 30 years I have witnessed the complete disregard by online contact lens retailers especially Hubble , Lensdirect , and walgreens to fill contact lens orders despite our response to them not for whatever reason ( expired rx, wrong rx , wrong brand ) please stop these and other companies by doing this ASAP! Thank you\n\nArleen\n\nOctober 18, 2018\n\nIn reply to As an eye care professional by Kanela Siskos \n\nFor your information had an appointment today with an Optometrist in Target Optical for an eye contact exam.  I left with expired trial contact lenses that she gave me and she did not have the multi-vision lenses that I needed so she gave me expired lenses to test if I like the brand &quot;Dailies Total 1&quot;  for dry eyes.  I buy online for just about everything and that is for better prices, easy returns and free shipping.   I had more problems not buying things off line then online.  The contacts the Doctors office quoted me was $90.00 for dailies 3 month supply per eye.  Online same contacts $58.00 for dailies 3 month supply per eye plus free shipping.  I was told by the doctors office they would match any price I find online.  After the expired trials I do not think that will happen.  You are just angry you are losing money by internet sales and you need to start thinking of doing the same!\n\nAntonia Siciliano\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nPlease enforce these laws to safeguard my patients’ eye health.  Regular  corneal evaluations are crucial  to preserving the gift of sight!\n\nBinh Nguyen OD, FAAO\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nI recently saw a 30 year old female patient who have reported  that her eyes have been red for the past few months. She tried to used many different over the counter eye drops to resolve the issue but could not. I asked about her contact lens wear habit and she mentioned that she started using  Hubble contact for the past few months. I asked her who approved that RX and she said no one. She simply just entered her own RX online and received her Contacts within a few days. We on our end never received any request for contact versification from Hubble. Upon examining her eyes, I saw significant bad blood vessels grow on her cornea- which indicative of lack of oxygen to the eye and poor contact lens fit. If continues, these problems will lead to permanent blindness in the eyes. I informed her of the exam findings and the patient were completely shock to find out that her red eye were associated with her Hubble contact. She said if she were to know that Hubble contact  material is more than 40 year old and would harm the health of her eyes as well as threatening her sight, she would never order it. She also assumes that she thought it is ok to use since she never get a rejection from Hubble saying that her doctor didn’t approve the contacts . Please law makers, put a stop to these uncontrolled online ordering. If not one day, your kids or grandchildren will find themselves in this patient shoes.\n\nDimple kapoor\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nAtleast once a week I see a patient with complaint of headache or asthenopia , who has been wearing wrong prescription for months since they bought contact lenses online and online vendors failed to verify the prescription or fulfil the order rightly.  All my patients leave with contact lens prescription after exam . Recently my staff members started complaining that if online vendors do send verification request, voicemail is all jumbled up , they don’t leave patients full name and no phone number to call back to speak to a person. Only voicemail to call back to leave a message. No follow up calls. If we do make out patient’s name we send out yes to fill if Rx is right and not to fill because prescription is wrong or expired. We also call patients when we say no to fill contact lens Rx, and learn 9/10 times that vendor has already send supply to them even though our office said not to fill. \nThis new rule only puts more burden on small office like mine and does not do anything to enforce the current laws and rule on online vendors. \nPatient issues will not be solved by this. Patients will still receive supply on wrong or expired prescription. \nSincerely \nDimple Kapoor\n\nJessica Rudolph, OD\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nEvery one of my patients is given a copy of their contact lens prescriptions as soon as it is finalized.  I do not profit from the sale of contact lenses.  It is not a part of my business.  I follow the state rules on the expiration dates of contact lenses.  I am a part of a small business that follows the rules and looks after the best interest of my patients.  I treat each of them how I would want myself or family treated.  I have been very disheartened by the tactics of many online contact lens sales companies.  We receive faxes and passive phone verifications in the middle of the night with orders being filled with or without denial/ corrections for the prescribed contact lenses.   \nI recently had a patient that finally came in after ordering lenses online for several years without a valid prescription.  She was not my patient previous to this visit but told me that she would just order what was on her box from 4 years ago and she thought it was Ok since they just kept sending more lenses.  She finally came in because she no longer could see out of them, and had 20/40 and 20/60 vision (barely making the legal driving cutoff for MN).  It was discovered through the exam that she had severe Contact lens induced keratitis and corneal edema, and we were initially unable to correct her vision for any improvement.  She was removed from contacts, treated medically, and was successfully refit back into a more appropriate lens 1 month later thankfully now able to be corrected back to 20/20 in both eyes.  This cost her and the insurance company hundreds of dollars in medications and office visits (not the online company that illegally sold her the lenses).   \nThis is just one example and the problem is getting worse, despite the current law.  Enacting new rules would create an undue burden on my practice without enforcing current rules that hold dispensers accountable for their illegal activity.  \nIt is my sincere hope that instead of adding more rules, that the FTC simply hold all parties involved accountable and enforce the current rules already in place. \n\nSincerely yours,\nDr. Jessica Loehr\nOptometrist, MN\n\nmichael ottati\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nhow about enforcing the law that currently exists? Contact lens verifications do not occur consistently. Unauthorized substitutions are made all of the time. Verifications over the phone are often not understandable, and often do not even give the patient name. Tricks are attempted to try to get the person answering the phone to say 'yes' and then then are hung up on, as they've received 'verification'. (i.e. &quot;can you hear me ok&quot; is NOT the verification of a contact lens Rx, when no patient name has been given, nor any Cl Rx parameters given). If my business has to follow the laws, so should online retailers.\n\nElias Keith, OD\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nI appreciate your time and efforts, but without enforcement of these rules they are just a waste of time.  Many of the big online cl sellers ignore these rules and nothing happens to them.\n\nJ S\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nEvery single patient that I fit for contact lenses leaves with a written prescription after I have finalized the Rx. We have made efforts to reduce the paper consumption in our office and this change would put a dramatic burden on our day to day operations and efforts, as we are trying to provide medical care rather than having patients sign documents like they are buying a new car. \n\nContact lenses are medical devices, and should be treated that way amongst all involved parties. That includes retailers that are not licensed to comply to standards as well. It is outrageous that people are encouraged by online retailers to skip the doctor visit and renew their Rx. \n\nIt is my sincere hope that instead of adding red tape and more useless rules, the FTC sees fit to simply hold all parties involved accountable and enforce the current rules already in place\n\nScott C\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nI just had a patient in his 20s come in two weeks ago for an annual contact lens exam.  He had no symptoms and no other concerns.  Through the exam I ended up saving his life as he had a mass in his brain and was told by the neurosurgeon had he not come in for his annual eye exam the condition would have been fatal.  If it was up to these online contact lens re-sellers who have avoided the law and acted unethically since their inception this young man would be dead.  Contact lenses are a medical device and these re-sellers should have to follow the rules already on the books.  Their end goal, unlike doctors who take an oath to protect their patients, is only profit and greed.  They (the online re-sellers) care nothing about eye health or the importance of in person exams and continue to pour money into buying off legislators.\n\nDr. Spiro Antonacos\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nReceive between 5 to 10  Robo calls  a day from contact lens online companies such as1 800 contacts for contact lens prescription verification of patients who don't belong to my practice. The majority come on off hours. .Because they get no response one way or another they will designate my office uncooperative  and sell the contacts to the patient without any kind of authorization.\n\nJH\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nI am an optometrist and I have had several patients order free contact lens trials online that were not approved under my care. These lenses have cause damage to the patients eyes. Unfortunately, these lenses were marketed on social media with no mention of how dangerous ordering the wrong prescription or a material that was not suited for their eyes could be. They were also lucky to not be permanently blinded. Since these new companies are not held to the same standards as doctors they are getting away with unsafe practices. The FTC should look into all companies dispensing “free trials” without medical professional supervision. This is a medical device and should be treated accordingly with a licensed doctor.\n\nHa Huynh\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nI have to re-educate patients on their poor (often extremely poor) contact lenses wearing habits in the office; it is way too often for my liking and way too often for the overall health of their eyes. I have no issue where patients choose to buy their supply, but there should not be substitutions due to situations like, poor vision and fitting then followed by red eye complications. More time spent re-educating patients on proper wearing compliance, risk of ugly eye complications due to CL overwear, etc. Often, this comes too late and damage is already done to their special sensory organs—you only get the eyes you are born with, and it’s not exactly replaceable. First and always, do no harm. Keep others from harming themselves.\n\nMichael Hall\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nI am an optometry student. I have no problem giving contact lens prescriptions to patients or companies, what I do have a problem with is these companies changing my prescription without authorization, refilling a prescription year after year without a current prescription or using deceptive practices to obtain an authorization. All of these practices endanger the eye sight of my patients.\n\nDr Cody Patterson\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nAs an optometrist there are serious implications when it comes to patients and how they abuse their contacts. I know all of the online sales have no care about patients eyes and seeing these comments of people who abuse their contacts regularly is just another reason not too allow it to continue. I know 1800 only cares about how much money they make and they have no problem giving patients conact lenses regardless of correctness. This Is another serious issue. As long as patients just refill their lenses without proper verification, they can be seriously under corrected and harm themselves or others. As long as people abuse contact lenses, they put themselves at risk of going permanently blind because of lack of oxygen getting to the eye. That is why it is so important to make sure they are evaluated by an optometrist who actually cares about the longevity of the patients vision to ensure proper fit and proper corrections.\nSincerely,\nDr Cody Patterson\n\nKala Brewer\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nPatients are already free to take their contact lens prescription anywhere they want. At the end of the contact lens fitting process, patients get a printed prescription and can purchase lenses anywhere they choose. \n\nI have seen countless patients who order lenses online but are given the wrong ones, or they are able to keep ordering them over and over without an eye exam. I end up seeing them later when they have a nasty eye infection or have other complications as a result of wearing the wrong lenses. Then people have to pay for their high deductible medical visits to treat the infection and spend much more money than they would have if they paid their $10 VSP copay, or even paid full price out of pocket for an exam. \n\nThis problem is getting worse, despite the current law. Enacting new rules would create an undue burden on my practice without enforcing current rules that hold unlicensed dispensers of medical devices accountable for their illegal behavior.\n\nDr. J. M. Bedd…\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nFirst, the FTC is attempting to assert authority in the commerce of a medical device. While the economic impacts and fairness to consumers may fall under the FTC’s jurisdiction it must not put commerce over safety. It must also not place undo burden on an entire profession when current rules for contact lens prescription release and verification are statistically violated in higher numbers, not by the prescribers, but by the filler of said prescriptions.  One more form to sign is ridiculous in today’s atmosphere of exponential growth in health care regulation. Apply existing laws. It is that simple. If the FTC has no intent on sanctioning those who improperly fill contacts lenses while at the same time implying more regulation on prescribers, especially without evidence to support it, then the FTC may as well sell adds to internet sites because they appear to have you all bought and paid for.\n\nDavid Reyes,OD\n\nApril 05, 2018\n\nI'm sick and tired of 1 800 Contacts and other companies approving contact lens prescriptions that are over a year old without the proper follow up from the optometrist.

Cook, …\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nI find it shocking that a patient can receive contact lenses (medical devices that can affect eye health) without a prescription or physical evaluation of the fit of the lenses.  All of my patients are automatically provided a written copy of their prescription when the fit is completed.  The prescription is specific for the lens they were fit in as all contact lenses fit differently.  Material, curvature, modulous, diameter, edge design are just a few of the parameters in prescribing a lens.  \n\nOnline sellers are not concerned about the ocular health of their customers.  They are only interested in making a quick sale.  Why else would they call after hours or have a automated call that is impossible to understand?  Rather than waiting for an authorization, the prescription is simply filled.  \n\nRecently I had a patient that came in for her annual eye examination.  She told me she had refilled her Rx through Hubble.  I was surprised as I NEVER received a verification request.  Thankfully she was unable to wear the lenses as they were very uncomfortable and were the incorrect curvature for her.  \n\nPlease do not let online retailers risk patient’s ocular  health.  Just like prescription medication, contact lens prescriptions must be properly verified and dispensed as written. \n\nSincerely,\nRita D. Cook, OD, FAAO\n\nRebecca Loerzel\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nWould I like to see an overhaul of the contact lens law? Absolutely.  I would like it to be changed so that it is actually meaningful. \n\nI have been in practice for 16 years, working inside a Walmart Vision Center.  I would estimate 80% of the prescription verifications we receive are for prescriptions that are expired, wrong, both, or for patients that have never been seen at our office.  We duly send them back immediately, but I have no doubt 90% of them are filled anyway. If at first they don’t succeed, they try try again, until they get lucky and somone misses the ridiculous 8 hour verification window, or they find a vendor who will sell to them anyway. Most of the phone verifications are deliberately vague or difficult to understand, so offices cannot properly verify them. The only thing stopping patients from buying their lenses outside their doctors’ offices are the few denials that are actually properly handled. Patients can make up anything they want, order online, and receive the lenses. Passive verification should end, and prescriptions should be regulated as they are at a pharmacy. \n\nThe proposal to require a signed receipt of contact lens prescription is an unreasonable burden on the patient and the practitioner. The last thing consumers want is more paperwork to sign. I often give my patients more than one option to try, and have them call to finalize the prescription. This new law would require me to have all of these patients return to my office to sign a piece of paper. I don’t think that will make consumers happy; it would be a waste of their time and mine. It is extremely rare we have any difficulty obtaining a prescription from another office; this is simply not a problem. The vast majority of doctors provide the CL prescription as soon as it is finalized, and again later if the patient needs another copy. Of course there are a few who don’t follow the law, but does it make sense to create an additional burden for all other doctors and their patients rather than punishing the few who don’t comply?  I don’t believe so.\n\nDon’t believe the online retailers trying to claim they are protecting consumers’ rights. They only thing they care about is their own profit.   I write all of the above as an optometrist who has never made any income from selling contact lenses. These sales mean nothing to me. The health of my patients eyes (and the rest of their bodies—you can diagnose a lot of conditions through an eye exam) does.  The proposed changes are not to help consumers, they are to help retailers make more money.\n\nBrandi Mc\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nI live and practice in an arrid, high altitude environment. Lens choices matter in this climate. Annual corneal health checks are crucial. Efforts to enforce online companies to verify and comply with my medical eye recommendations in a less obstructionistic manner, to properly enforce current rules rather than adding more, are crucial for public safety.\n\nLee Azpiroz, OD\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nContact lenses are medical devices that need to be properly regulated.   Not doing so places patients at risk for permanent vision loss.  Routine eye care not only protects a patient's vision, but may reveal serious health issues.  Illegal sales of contact lenses places patient's vision and overt all health at risk. \n\nThe FTC needs to enforce current regulations on all dispensers of contact lenses, including online resellers and retailers.  The numerous sources of contact lenses have made the price of contact lenses very competitive.   Price and convenience are no longer the major issue,  it's patient safety. \n\nPrescribers are already unfairly held liable for prescriptions that resellers often illegally change to make a sale.  Additional regulations only further penalize small businesses with additional costs.\n\nBradley Cross OD\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nI've had many occasions when retailers have filled expired prescriptions even after we have sent them documentation within the ridiculous time requirement. There seems to be increased propensity for this behavior with the addition of new retailers in the marketplace. Convenience for the customer is important but it should never take the priority of proper healthcare out of first place.\n\nPaul Levine\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nThis change will add an unnecessary burden to practices and patients. As it is people are becoming more and more wary of paperwork, signing documents, etc. Medical offices are being buried by paperwork, data storage, unreasonable compliance demands and inane policies. Giving a patient a copy of their contact lens prescription is easy. Forcing them to sign an acknowledgment of receipt of said document is excessive and silly. And certainly proposed by someone not at all involved at providing eye and vision Care to patients. Don’t we have more important things to work on?\n\nCathy Ong\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nBuying contacts online without appropriate verification is like buying prescription drugs without a doctors prescription.  If the contact lens does not fit right and is too tight it can lead to conditions like corneal ulcers and infections which sometimes leads to permanent vision loss.  I've had many patients who buy online like from Hubble who complain of their eyes hurting and they can't see. This company doesn't even verify prescriptions which is illegal but this still goes on. We need the FTC to enforce these rules in order to protect patients eyes, prevent people losing vision and going on disability.\n\nAmy Lee\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nI always dispense a contact lens prescription after a complete evaluation has been performed to evaluate the vision, health and fit of this medical device that we call a contact lens. I do not hold a patient's prescription &quot;hostage&quot; because it is their right to have access to their medical information. \n\nHowever contact lenses are not just a consumer product that patients are simply entitled to- there are very real medical consequences to the way online retailers sell contact lenses and subvert the medical examination required to wear contact lenses in a healthy manner.  I vividly remember a teenage patient that I saw when I was a resident doctor who developed permanent corneal scarring from contact lens abuse. She will never see better than 20/70! Contact lenses are a medical device that require prescriptions (and therefore routine examinations) and the FTC should enforce the regulations in place to recognize what that means. \n\nI proudly and dutifully carry out my responsibility to ensure that my patients are seeing well and that this piece of plastic that sits on their eyes all day does not impair their health. I sell contacts but I do not care where patients buy their supply as long as they have a current prescription. I do not depend on selling contacts and do not alter my responsibility as a doctor just to sell more of them. In contrast the retailer's only burden is to ensure they make a profit. They make no profit from making sure a consumer has healthy eyes nor the proper vision from their contact lenses. \n\nThank you for your consideration, \nAmy Lee, OD\n\nAmy Lee\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nI always dispense a contact lens prescription after a complete evaluation has been performed to evaluate the vision, health and fit of this medical device that we call a contact lens.

Oftentimes, this will require the patient to come to the office to sign the paperwork proposed by this regulation, creating additional burden on both the patient and the staff.

The current state of CL sales is quickly turning into a FLEA MARKET situation.  Doctors are required, by law, to follow state requirements, Standards Of Care and are held responsible for outcomes that result from not following those guidelines.  Online CL retailers have no such guidelines but when patients have an unfortunate outcome from buying CLs that were not prescribed by their doctor such as a corneal ulcer, the subsequent lawsuit ALWAYS includes the patient’s doctor because, of course, they are the professional and they should have somehow stopped this from happening.  Of the three parties involved here(Doctors/U.S. Government/Online Retailers), only one party has no interest in the care and safety of the public.  The online retailers are strictly focused on sales of WHATEVER lenses they can sell to patients.  Doctors are restricted as to how and what services they can bill Medicare and other insurance plans, but online retailers can sell CLs from EXPIRED prescriptions with no consequence.  This isn’t the American way, it’s not even logical.  Federal, state statutes and industry Standards of Care should apply to all parties involved with our patients.\n\nLauren Plass\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nI am not aware of any offices that are not releasing a valid CLRx after a fitting has been done. What I am aware of is the lack of action taken against online companies from illegally selling contact lenses to consumers. I have seen multiple occurrences where 1-800 will send an authorization verifying a prescription when the office is closed, even though it's been reported back numerous times that the office is closed during those hours. It is just a ploy to pretend they are abiding by the law so they can go ahead and send expired and incorrect contact lenses. I had a patient last month who has been able to receive her contact lenses for 10 years without coming in for an eye exam because 1-800 continued to send boxes. Hubble is the newest contender and is even worse than 1800; they market an outdated contact lens as a new option to consumers. They send boxes to patients without any rx at all. I have so far seen one patient in the last two months come in with a corneal ulcer from said contact lenses. Hubble pretends to verify the Rx by calling and leaving a garbled message with the intention of trying to trick staff into saying yes at some point in order to fill Rx. These contact lenses are unhealthy for the eye, and I am not aware of any Dr that would actually prescribe such a terrible lens.\n\nDr. Han Duong\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nEnforcing the current laws that exist to protect the public health would be a more efficient way of using our time instead of adding new ones.

It has been my experience that patients ordering contact lenses online tend to over-wear the contacts, which are medical devices, resulting in damage to the eyes and vision. Contacts received from online orders are frequently a different power, brand or manufacturer that what was prescribed. It is already burdensome for my staff to listen to a garbled verification voicemail from online contact lens sales companies. Having to provide additional paperwork for my office is beyond unreasonable and will not provide any benefit as many online companies fill prescriptions even after we have told them they are invalid, inaccurate or otherwise expired. \n\nThere is no justification for targeting eye doctors—optometrists and ophthalmologists—and our patients with new paperwork and document storage requirements as your misguided Contact Lens Rule proposal would do, while the Commission allows retailers who blatantly violate the law to operate unchecked. Your agency’s own complaint data confirms that doctors comply with the law, a finding that Members of Congress have specifically recognized in Congressional hearings with FTC officials and further affirmed on March 23rd through passage of 2018 government funding legislation (Public Law 115-141) and the following report directive: \n\nContact Lenses—The [Senate Appropriations] Committee is disappointed in the FTC’s decision not to include the proposed patient safety improvements related to the prescription verification process in its draft contact lens rule and instead impose new paperwork requirements on patients and doctors that are unnecessarily burdensome. The Committee directs the FTC to prioritize patient safety and consider enforcement mechanisms under its existing authority or revisions to the draft rule that address sales of excessive quantities of lenses, illegal substitutions, and communication challenges associated with prescription verification, including robo-calls. The Committee further directs the FTC to continue to confer and consult with other Federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, to optimize its enforcement and consumer education activities.\n\nThere are many voices purportedly paying consultants to voice unfounded claims about why you should continue with the proposed rule. I urge you to listen to the nation’s eye doctors and other public health experts in recognizing contact lenses as a medical device and by joining with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in making quality care and patient health and safety a priority in Washington, DC.\n\nSincerely,\nAudrey Brumley, OD\n\nDr Lisa Williams\n\nApril 06, 2018\n\nThe verification process (when I get one ) is horrible.

But purchasing a franchise is like any other investment: there’s no guarantee of success.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, has prepared this Guide to help you decide if a franchise is right for you. It suggests ways to shop for a franchise opportunity and highlights key questions you need to ask before you invest. The Guide also explains how to use the disclosure document that franchisors must give you — under the FTC’s Franchise Rule — so you can investigate and evaluate a franchise opportunity.\n\nThe Franchise Business Model\n\nIs a Franchise Right for You?\n\nFinding the Right Opportunity\n\nSelecting a Franchise\n\nThe Franchise Disclosure Document\n\nEvaluating Potential Earnings\n\nBefore You Sign the Franchise Agreement\n\nThe Franchise Business Model\n\nA franchise enables you, the investor or franchisee, to operate a business. You pay a franchise fee and you get a format or system developed by the company (franchisor), the right to use the franchisor’s name for a specific number of years and assistance. For example, the franchisor may provide you with help in finding a location for your outlet; initial training and an operating manual; and advice on management, marketing or personnel. The franchisor may provide support through periodic newsletters, a toll-free telephone number, a website or scheduled workshops or seminars.\n\nOwning a franchise comes with defined costs, franchisor controls and contractual obligations.\n\nCosts\n\nIn exchange for the right to use the franchisor’s name and benefit from the franchisor’s assistance, you will pay some or all of the following:\n\nInitial Franchise Fee and Other Expenses \n\nYour initial franchise fee will typically range from tens of thousands of dollars to several hundred thousand dollars and may be non-refundable. You may face significant costs to rent, build and equip an outlet and to buy initial inventory. You also may have to pay for operating licenses and insurance and a “grand opening” fee to the franchisor to promote your new outlet.\n\nContinuing Royalty Payments \n\nYou may have to pay the franchisor royalties based on a percentage of your weekly or monthly gross income. Typically, you must pay royalties for the right to use the franchisor’s name, even if you are losing money. You may have to pay royalties for the duration of your franchise agreement even if the franchisor doesn’t provide the services it promised and even if you decide to terminate your franchisee agreement early.\n\nAdvertising Fees \n\nYou also may have to contribute to an advertising fund. Some portion of the advertising fees may be allocated to national advertising or to attract new franchise owners, rather than to promote your outlet.\n\nFranchisor Controls\n\nTo ensure uniformity, franchisors usually control how franchisees conduct business. These controls may significantly restrict your ability to exercise your own business judgment. A franchisor may control:\n\nSite Approval \n\nMany franchisors retain the right to approve sites for their outlets, and may not approve a site you select. Some franchisors conduct extensive site studies as part of the approval process and a site they approve may be more likely to attract customers.\n\nDesign or Appearance Standards \n\nFranchisors may impose design or appearance standards to ensure a uniform look among their outlets. Some franchisors require periodic renovations or design changes; complying with these requirements may increase your costs.\n\nRestrictions on Goods and Services You Sell \n\nFranchisors may restrict the goods and services you sell. For example, if you own a restaurant franchise, you may not be able to make any changes to your menu. If you own an automobile transmission repair franchise, you may not be able to perform other types of automotive work, like brake or electrical system repairs.\n\nRestrictions on Method of Operation \n\nFranchisors may require that you operate in a particular way. They may dictate hours; pre-approve signs, employee uniforms and advertisements; or demand that you use certain accounting or bookkeeping procedures. In some cases, a franchise advertising cooperative may require you to sell some goods or services at specific discounted prices, which may affect your profits. Or, the franchisor may require that you buy supplies only from an approved supplier, even if you can buy similar goods elsewhere for less.\n\nRestrictions on Sales Area \n\nA franchisor may limit your business to a specific location or sales territory. If you have an “exclusive” or “protected” territory, it may prevent the franchisor and other franchisees from opening competing outlets or serving customers in your territory, but it may not protect you from all competition by the franchisor. For example, the franchisor may have the right to offer the same goods or services in your sales area through its own website, catalogs, other retailers or competing outlets of a different company-owned franchise.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nFranchise contracts last only for the number of years stated in the contract. You can lose the right to your franchise if you don’t comply with the contract. You won’t have a right to renew unless the franchisor gives you that right.\n\nTerminations \n\nA franchisor can end your franchise agreement for a variety of reasons, including your failure to pay royalties or abide by performance standards and sales restrictions. Many franchise contracts will give you a chance to “cure” an occasional failure to comply (like making one late payment) but keep the right to terminate your franchise for other failures. If your franchise is terminated, you’re likely to lose your entire investment.\n\nRenewals \n\nFranchise agreements may run for as long as 20 years. Renewals are not automatic. At the end of the contract term, the franchisor may decline to renew or may offer a renewal that doesn’t have the same terms and conditions as your original contract. For example, the franchisor may raise the royalty payments, impose new design standards and sales restrictions, or reduce your territory. Any of these changes may result in higher costs, reduced profits or more competition from company-owned outlets or other franchisees.\n\nIs a Franchise Right for You?\n\nBefore you invest in a particular franchise system, think about how much money you have to invest, your abilities and your goals. Be brutally honest.\n\nYour Investment\n\nHow much money do you have to invest?\n\nHow much money can you afford to lose?\n\nAre you purchasing the franchise alone or with partners?\n\nDo you need financing? Where will you get it? What’s your credit rating and credit score?\n\nDo you have savings or additional income to live on until your franchise opens and, you hope, becomes profitable?\n\nYour Abilities\n\nDoes the franchise require technical experience or special training or education — for example, auto repair, home and office decorating or tax preparation?\n\nWhat special skills can you bring to this business?\n\nWhat experience do you have as a business owner or manager?\n\nYour Goals\n\nWhat are your reasons for buying a particular franchise?\n\nDo you need a specific minimum annual income?\n\nDo you want to work in a particular field?\n\nAre you interested in retail sales or performing a service?\n\nHow many hours can you work? How many are you willing to work?\n\nDo you intend to operate the business yourself or hire a manager?\n\nWill franchise ownership be your main source of income or a supplement to your current income?\n\nAre you in this for the long term?\n\nWould you like to own several outlets?\n\nAre you willing to let the franchisor be your boss?\n\nFinding the Right Opportunity\n\nThere are many ways other than franchisors’ websites to find information about franchise opportunities, including visiting local franchised outlets, looking at franchise handbooks, attending franchise expositions and working with franchise brokers.\n\nLocal Outlets\n\nIt’s always a good idea to visit franchised outlets in your area and talk to the owners about their experience with particular franchisors.\n\nFranchise Handbook\n\nA “franchise opportunities handbook,” available from a library or online, will list available franchises by type of business and provide basic information about each franchise. You can use a handbook to find a franchise if you don’t know the type of business you want, or to see which franchises are available for the type of business that interests you.\n\nFranchise Exposition\n\nAttending a franchise exposition allows you to see and compare a variety of franchise possibilities at one time. Before you attend, research the kind of franchise that may best suit your budget, experience and goals. When you attend, visit several franchise exhibitors who deal with the type of industry that appeals to you. Ask questions, including:\n\nHow many franchised outlets are there? Where are they?\n\nWhat is the initial franchise fee? What are the additional start-up costs?\n\nAre there continuing royalty payments? How much are they?\n\nWhat management, technical and other support does the franchisor offer?\n\nWhat controls does the franchisor impose?\n\nHow long has the franchisor been in business?\n\nExhibitors may offer you incentives to attend a promotional meeting to discuss the franchise in detail. These meetings can be another source of information and give you a chance to raise questions, but they may also expose you to high-pressure sales tactics. Be prepared to walk away from any franchise opportunity — and promotion — that does not fit your needs.\n\nFranchise Broker\n\nFranchise brokers may call themselves “business coaches,” “advisors,” “referral sources” or “sales consultants.” They often advertise on the internet and in business magazines, offering to help you select among various franchise options. Typically, a broker reviews the amount of money you have to invest and then directs you to opportunities that match your interests and resources. A broker also may help you finish applications and the paperwork to complete the sale. Brokers often work for franchisors, and are paid only if a sale is made.\n\nBefore you decide to use a broker, consider whether you need a broker’s services or could get enough information by shopping online or reading trade magazines.\n\nWhat choices does the broker offer? \n\nSome franchise brokers may claim to be able to match you with “the perfect opportunity” because they represent a wide range of business sellers. That may be true — or not.\n\nAsk how many franchisors the broker represents. A broker who represents only a few franchisors will give you limited suggestions.\n\nHow does the broker select franchises? \n\nSome franchise brokers may claim they will suggest only those franchises that meet certain standards. You may think this means that your risk is limited because the broker weeds out poor investments. In fact, some brokers represent any franchisor willing to pay them a commission for a sale. A broker who does that might direct you to a franchisor that is failing or doesn’t have a strong history.\n\nAsk how the broker selects franchisors to represent. Ask to see the selection criteria and how many franchisors the broker has recently turned down.\n\nHow is the broker paid? \n\nSome brokers earn a flat fee regardless of the price of the franchise they sell. Others earn a commission based on the cost of the franchise. These brokers may steer you toward a more costly franchise to increase their commission.\n\nAsk who pays the broker and how the payment is calculated. Find out whether the broker earns a commission based on the cost of the franchise. If he or she does, consider whether the broker is suggesting a higher priced franchise in order to earn a larger commission.\n\nAre the broker’s earnings claims reliable? \n\nTo convince you to buy a particular franchise, a broker may talk about how much money you can make. These claims may not be true or can be misleading. For example, the figures may be based on earnings in an area where there is high demand for the franchisor’s goods or services. Or the claim may be based on outdated industry data. In some instances, earnings claims may use gross sales figures, but when you consider likely expenses, you may find that actual earnings will be far less. Because earnings representations may be misleading, franchisors usually don’t allow their sales representatives to make claims about sales, income or profits unless the claims are included in the franchise disclosures the franchisor must give you.\n\nThe required franchise disclosures will list the names and contact information for the franchisor’s current and former franchisees. Talk to them, rather than relying on information from the broker alone. Ask about their experience with the franchisor.\n\nSelecting a Franchise\n\nPurchasing a franchise is like any other investment: it comes with risk. When you consider a particular franchise, think about demand for the products or services it offers, whether competitors offer similar products or services, the level of support you will receive and the franchisor’s reputation.\n\nDemand\n\nIs there a demand for the franchisor’s products or services in your community? Is it seasonal or evergreen? Could you be dealing with a fad? Does the product or service generate repeat business? Is the franchisor’s name so well known that it will bring in customers, or will you have to create a market for the franchise?\n\nCompetition\n\nWhat’s the level of competition — nationally, regionally and locally? How many franchised and company-owned outlets are in your area? Does the franchise sell products or services that are easily available online or through a catalog? How many competing companies, including competing franchises, sell similar products or services at a similar price? Are those companies well established or widely recognized in your community?\n\nYour Ability to Operate the Business\n\nSometimes, franchise systems fail. What will happen to your business if the franchisor closes up shop? Will you need the franchisor’s ongoing training, advertising or other help to remain in business? Will you have access to the same suppliers? Could you conduct the business alone if you have to cut costs or lay anyone off?\n\nName Recognition\n\nBuying a franchise gives you the right to associate with the franchisor’s name or brand. An established franchise with a well-known name — and good reputation — is more likely to draw customers than a relatively new or unknown franchise. If you invest in a franchise, you’ll be responsible for creating customer demand for its goods or services in your area.\n\nConsider:\n\nhow long the franchisor has been in business\n\nname and brand recognition for the franchisor and its products or services\n\nwhether the franchisor has a reputation for quality products or services\n\nYou’ll want to find out from the required disclosure document whether the franchisor has a federally registered trademark. If it doesn’t, a company using the same mark in your area could force you to change the name or mark of your outlet at your expense.\n\nComplaints About the Franchise\n\nIt’s also a good idea to check whether consumers or franchisees have filed complaints against the franchise or franchisor with franchise regulators, Better Business Bureaus (BBBs) or local consumer protection agencies in your state or the franchisor’s home state. Read more about how to check out a franchise in “Additional Sources of Information” at the end of this Guide.\n\nTraining and Support Services\n\nWhat training and continuing support does the franchisor provide? Does the training measure up to the training provided by other franchisors in the same type of business and for workers in that field? Can you compete with others who have more formal training? What backgrounds do the current franchise owners have? Is your education, experience or training similar? What do current franchise owners say about the quality and usefulness of the training they received?\n\nFranchisor’s Experience\n\nMany franchisors that operate well-established companies have years of experience selling goods or services and managing a franchise system. Some franchisors started by operating their own business. There’s no guarantee, however, that a successful entrepreneur can successfully manage a franchise system. Find out how long the franchisor has managed a franchise system. Does the franchisor have enough expertise to make you feel comfortable? If the franchisor has little experience managing a chain of franchises, take promises about guidance, training and other support with the proverbial grain of salt.\n\nGrowth\n\nA growing franchise system increases the franchisor’s name and brand recognition and may enable you to attract customers. But growth alone doesn’t ensure that franchisees will be successful. In fact, a franchisor that grows too quickly may not be able to support its franchisees with the services it promises them. Investigate the franchisor’s financial assets and resources. Are they sufficient to support you and all the other new outlets the franchisor plans to open?\n\nThe Franchise Disclosure Document\n\nBefore you invest in any franchise, get a copy of the franchisor’s Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD). Under the Franchise Rule enforced by the FTC, you must receive the document at least 14 days before you are asked to sign any contract or pay any money to the franchisor or an affiliate of the franchisor. You have the right to ask for — and get — a copy of the FDD once the franchisor has received your application and agreed to consider it. Indeed, you may want to get a copy of the franchisor’s FDD before you spend any money to investigate the franchise offering. The franchisor may give you a copy of its FDD on paper, via email, through a web page or on a disc. The cover of the FDD must provide information about the available formats. Make sure you have a copy of the FDD in a format that is convenient for you, and keep a copy for reference.\n\nRead each of the 23 numbered “Items” in the FDD. Don’t be shy about asking for explanations, clarifications and answers to your questions before you invest. Here are some key sections of the FDD:\n\nFranchisor’s Background (FDD Item 1)\n\nItem 1 tells you how long the franchisor has been in business and its likely competition. It also lets you know if there any legal requirements unique to the franchised business, like a requirement that you get a special license or permit. This will help you understand the costs and risks you will take on if you purchase and operate the franchise.\n\nBusiness Background (FDD Item 2)\n\nItem 2 identifies the executives of the franchise system and describes their experience. Pay attention to their general business backgrounds, their experience in managing a franchise system and how long they’ve been with the franchisor.\n\nLitigation History (FDD Item 3)\n\nItem 3 lists important information about prior litigation — whether the franchisor or any of its executive officers have been convicted of felonies involving fraud, violations of franchise law, or unfair or deceptive practices law, or are subject to any state or federal injunctions involving similar misconduct. This item will tell you whether the franchisor or any of its executives have been held liable for — or settled civil actions involving — the franchise relationship. If there have been many claims against the franchisor, it may mean the franchisor has not performed according to its agreements. Or it could show that franchisees are dissatisfied with its performance. Item 3 also should say whether the franchisor has sued any of its franchisees during the last year. That disclosure may indicate common types of problems in the franchise system. For example, if a franchisor sued franchisees for failing to pay royalties, it could be because franchisees weren’t successful, and weren’t willing or able to make their royalty payments.\n\nBankruptcy (FDD Item 4)\n\nItem 4 discloses whether the franchisor or its predecessor, affiliates or any of its executives have been involved in a recent bankruptcy. If the franchisor or its predecessor or affiliate has declared bankruptcy, carefully review the franchisor’s financial statements in Item 21 of the FDD to see if the franchisor is financially capable of delivering the support services it promises. Consider having an accountant review the required financial statements too.\n\nInitial and Ongoing Costs (FDD Items 5-7)\n\nThese items describe some of the costs involved in starting and operating a franchise, including deposits or franchise fees that may be non-refundable, and costs for initial inventory, signs, equipment, leases or rentals. It also explains ongoing costs, like royalties and advertising fees. In addition, ask or find out about:\n\ngrand opening or other initial business promotions\n\nbusiness and operating licenses\n\nproduct or service supply costs\n\nreal estate and leasehold improvements\n\nrequired equipment, such as a computer system or a security system\n\ntraining\n\nbusiness insurance\n\ncompliance with local ordinances, such as zoning, waste removal, and fire and other safety codes\n\nemployee salaries\n\nYou’ll need to investigate other initial and ongoing costs that aren’t described in Items 5-7, such as the cost of accounting and legal help.\n\nIt may take several months to start your business, and it may take more than a year to break even. Some franchises never break even. Estimate your operating expenses for the first year and your personal living expenses for up to two years. Compare your cost estimates for the franchise with what other franchisees in this system and competing systems have paid. An accountant can help you evaluate this information. You may be able to do better with another franchisor.\n\nSupplier, Territory and Customer Restrictions (FDD Items 8 and 12)\n\nThese items tell you whether the franchisor limits:\n\nsuppliers from whom you may purchase goods\n\nthe goods or services you may offer for sale\n\nwhere and to whom you can sell goods or services\n\nyour use of the internet to sell goods or services to customers within and outside your territory\n\nthe right of the franchisor (or other franchisees) to use the internet to solicit customers or to sell in your territory\n\nThese kinds of restrictions may limit your ability to exercise your own business judgment in operating your outlet. If the franchisor does not limit the territory where each franchisee can sell, the franchisor and other franchisees may compete with you for the same customers by establishing their own outlets or selling through the internet, catalogs or telemarketing.\n\nFranchisor’s Advertising and Training (FDD Item 11)\n\nThe FDD includes important summaries of the franchise system’s advertising programs and the initial and ongoing training the franchisor will provide. Talk to the franchisor and current franchisees to get answers to your questions.\n\nAdvertising \n\nFranchisees are often required to contribute a percentage of their sales to one or more national, regional or local advertising funds. Ask the franchisor what advertising it has done and what is being planned. Ask whether franchisees have any control over how advertising dollars are spent, and if all franchisees and company outlets contribute equally to the advertising funds. Find out if the franchisor gets a commission or rebate when it places ads. If there is a rebate, who benefits — you or the franchisor?\n\nSee what percentage of the fund is spent on:\n\nadministrative costs\n\nnational advertising\n\nadvertising in your area\n\nselling more franchises\n\nother expenses\n\nRead Item 11 to learn whether franchisees need the franchisor’s consent to develop and buy their own advertising. If they buy their own advertising, do they get a rebate or discount on their advertising contribution?\n\nTraining \n\nNew franchisees typically count on the franchisor to provide all the business and operational training needed to run a successful franchise. The training you need depends on your business experience and knowledge of the franchisor’s goods and services. Check Item 11 for information about:\n\nthe trainers and their qualifications\n\nwho is eligible for training\n\nthe cost of training new employees and who pays\n\nthe length of training sessions\n\nthe amount of time spent on technical training, business management training and marketing\n\nwhether the franchisor offers ongoing training and at what cost\n\nwhether support staff are available for trouble-shooting in your area and how many franchisees they are responsible for\n\nwhether on-site individual assistance is available and at what cost\n\nBe sure to talk with recent franchisees about the quality of training the franchisor provides. If — after you read the information in Item 11 and talk with franchisees — you still aren’t sure you’ll get the training you need, ask the franchisor if you can review the training materials. If the franchisor won’t provide them, even if you volunteer to sign a confidentiality agreement, consider a different franchise opportunity.\n\nRenewal, Termination, Transfer and Dispute Resolution (FDD Item 17)\n\nItem 17 covers important topics. First, it states whether you can renew your franchise at the end of the term, and, if you can renew:\n\nwhat you must do to qualify for renewal\n\nwhether fees and other contract terms may change\n\nItem 17 also explains what your obligations would be to the franchisor after termination. For example, after termination, restrictions in the contract typically will stop you from operating a business that would compete with your prior franchise, if the new business is within a specified distance of your prior outlet. The restrictions may also prevent you from operating a new business within a specified distance of any other outlets of the franchise. The restrictions may last as long as three years.\n\nAdditionally, Item 17 describes what you must do to get the franchisor’s approval if you want to sell your franchise. Lastly, it states whether you have the right to go to court if you have a dispute with the franchisor, or must use arbitration instead.\n\nFinancial Performance Representations (FDD Item 19)\n\nItem 19 contains claims the franchisor chooses to make about the sales or earnings of its franchises for which there is a reasonable factual basis. The Franchise Rule doesn’t require a franchisor to provide sales or earnings information, but most do. Any claims the franchisor makes about sales, income or profits must be in Item 19. No other spoken or written financial performance claim may be made if it doesn’t appear in Item 19. There are two exceptions to this:\n\nThe franchisor may provide the actual records of an existing outlet you’re thinking of buying.\n\nThe franchisor may add to the information in Item 19. For example, the franchisor may provide information about possible performance at a particular location or under particular circumstances.\n\nFor tips on how to evaluate this information, see Evaluating Potential Earnings.\n\nFranchisee and Franchise System Information (FDD Item 20)\n\nItem 20 provides charts showing growth and owner turnover in the franchisor’s system. If the charts show more than a few franchised outlets in your area have closed, transferred to new owners, or transferred to the franchisor, it could be due to problems with the franchisor’s support or because franchises aren’t profitable.\n\nCurrent and Former Franchisees \n\nLook for the required disclosure of contact information for current franchisees and franchisees who have left the system during the franchisor’s last fiscal year. Talking to these people may be the most reliable way to verify the franchisor’s claims. Visit or phone as many of them as possible to chat about their experiences. Some current franchisees may be reluctant to talk to you if they’re having problems. If that’s the case, try contacting others on the list.\n\nSome franchisors may give you a separate reference list of franchisees to contact. To ensure you get the full picture, you may want to contact a number of franchisees listed in the disclosure document and some on the separate list. Talk to several franchisees who have been in business just over one year. They’re in the best position to tell you: their total investment\n\nwhether they were able to open their outlet in a reasonable time\n\nwhether they were satisfied with the franchisor’s training, opening assistance and advertising\n\nwhether the franchisor provided ongoing help and assistance\n\nwhether they have been able to break even\n\nIt’s also a good idea to talk to several franchisees who have been in business for five years. Ask:\n\nhow long it took them to break even, earn a reasonable income and recoup their investment\n\nwhether the franchisor is providing the services and assistance it promised and fulfilling its contractual obligations\n\nwhat problems, if any, they are having with the franchisor\n\nwhether they would invest in another outlet\n\nwhether they’re satisfied with the advertising program\n\nwhether they are satisfied with the cost, delivery and quality of goods or services they must buy from the franchisor, its affiliates or sole approved suppliers\n\nIt’s worth tracking down former franchisees (using contact information from Item 20), although some of them may have signed confidentiality agreements that prevent them from talking with you. Prior owners can tell you:\n\nthe problems they had with their outlet\n\nwhether they broke even or made a profit\n\nwhen and for how long they operated the outlet\n\ntheir business background\n\nwhy they left the franchise system\n\nSome franchisors may buy back failed outlets and list them as company-owned outlets. If you’re thinking about buying an existing outlet that the franchisor acquired from a prior franchisee, ask to see the financials showing the outlet’s actual operating results. The franchisor must tell you who owned and operated the outlet for the last five years. If a franchise has had several owners in a short time, perhaps the location isn’t profitable or the franchisor hasn’t supported that outlet as promised. Contact as many of the previous owners as possible to learn about their experience operating the outlet that failed.\n\nFranchisee Associations \n\nAssociations of a franchisor’s franchisees are an important source of information. Franchisors are required to list in the FDD the associations they sponsor or endorse and independent associations that ask to be listed. An association, whether it’s sponsored, endorsed or independent, can provide information about the relationship between the franchisor and its franchisees. You may want to ask members of a franchisee association about:\n\nthe kinds of system problems or issues they discuss\n\nsystem problems they successfully resolved\n\nany problems franchisees face in the operation of their outlets\n\nany problems franchisees have with the franchisor\n\nFinancial Statements (FDD Item 21)\n\nItem 21 provides the franchisor’s three most recent audited annual financial statements. If you know how to read financial statements, this information will give you a good understanding of the franchisor’s financial health. If you don’t, it’s a good idea to hire an accountant to review the statements and explain them to you. Investing in a financially unstable franchisor is a significant risk; the franchisor may go out of business or into bankruptcy after you have invested your money. An accountant can help you understand whether the franchisor:\n\nhas steady growth\n\nhas a growth plan\n\nmakes more of its income from royalty payments from successful existing franchisees or from the sale of franchises\n\ndevotes sufficient funds to support its franchise system\n\nEvaluating Potential Earnings\n\nYou may want to know how much money you can make if you invest in a particular franchise. A franchisor isn’t required to disclose information about potential income or sales. If it does, the law requires it to have a reasonable basis for the claim when it’s made and to include the claim in Item 19 of the FDD. If a franchisor makes a claim that has a reasonable basis, the FDD also must disclose:\n\nthe source and limitations of data that support the claim\n\nany important assumptions on which the claim is based\n\nBe sure to ask the franchisor for written substantiation that supports the claim. The franchisor is required to provide substantiation if you ask. An accountant can help you determine whether the claims are reasonable, and if they apply to how you plan to operate your business. When you review earnings claims, consider:\n\nIs the Earnings Claim Typical for a Franchise in this System?\n\nSuppose a franchisor claims that franchisees in its system earned $50,000 last year. The claim may be deceptive if it doesn’t represent the typical earnings of franchisees. The FDD should tell you how many franchises the franchisor has, how many it surveyed to get that figure, and the number and percentage of franchisees who reported earnings at the level claimed.\n\nAverage Income\n\nIf a franchisor claims that its franchisees earn an average income of $75,000 a year, that tells you very little about how individual franchises performed. Using an average figure may make a franchise system look more successful than it really is, because the high incomes of just a few very successful franchises can inflate the average for all franchisees.\n\nGross Sales\n\nSome franchisors provide figures for their franchisees’ gross sales. These figures don’t really tell about the franchisees’ actual costs or profits. An outlet with high gross sales on paper might be losing money because of high overhead, rent and other expenses.\n\nNet Profits\n\nFranchisors often don’t have data about their franchisees’ net profits. If you get profit information, ask if it’s based on information from company-owned outlets. Company-owned outlets often have lower costs because they can buy equipment, inventory and other items in larger quantities at lower prices or may own, rather than lease, their property.\n\nGeographic Relevance\n\nEarnings may vary with geography. If a franchisor provides franchisee sales or income figures, ask if any of the supporting data came from franchisees in your area. The FDD should state whether there are geographic differences between the franchisees whose earnings are reported and your likely location.\n\nFranchisees’ Backgrounds\n\nKeep in mind that franchisees have different skill sets and educational backgrounds. The success of some franchisees doesn’t guarantee success for all.\n\nReliance on Earnings Claims\n\nFranchisors may ask you to sign a statement — sometimes presented as a written interview or questionnaire — that asks whether you received any earnings or financial performance representations during the course of buying a franchise. If they told or gave you any information about how much your franchise may earn, report it fully on the questionnaire or other statement. If you don’t, you may be waiving any right to contest the earnings representations that were made to you and that you used to make your decision to buy.\n\nBefore You Sign the Franchise Agreement\n\nThe franchisor’s disclosures may change between the time you receive the FDD and the time you sign the franchise agreement. For example, the franchisor may have updated its FDD each calendar quarter and must update the FDD after its fiscal year ends. You have the right to ask for a copy of any updated information before you sign the franchise agreement. An updated FDD may reveal new lawsuits were filed by or against the franchisor, changes in the franchisor’s management or training teams, more current financial performance data or other useful information.\n\nAdditional Sources of Information\n\nAccountants and Lawyers \n\nIn addition to reading the franchisor’s FDD — including any updates — and speaking with current and former franchisees, consider talking to an accountant and a lawyer. An accountant can help you understand the franchisor’s financial statements, develop a business plan, assess any earnings projections and the assumptions they’re based on, and help you pick a franchise system that is best suited to your investment resources and your goals.\n\nA lawyer can help you understand your obligations under the franchise contract. These contracts usually are long and complex. A problem that comes up after you have signed the contract may be very expensive to fix — if it can be fixed at all. Choose a lawyer who is experienced in franchise matters, and rely on your lawyer or accountant for a recommendation about whether to buy a particular franchise.\n\nBanks and Other Financial Institutions \n\nIf you need financing to buy a franchise, a bank lender may be able to provide you with a Dun &amp; Bradstreet report or similar financial profile of the franchisor. The bank also might obtain sales and profit information from the franchisor, even if the franchisor won’t give you that information. However, some franchisors give banks unrealistic, overstated profit projections so the bank will provide financing to expand the franchise system. Remember that bank approval of a franchise loan doesn’t necessarily mean the franchise is a safe or good investment.\n\nBetter Business Bureau \n\nCheck with the local BBB in the cities where the franchisor has its headquarters and the city where you’re thinking of buying a franchise. Ask whether there are complaints on file about the franchisor’s products, services or personnel.\n\nGovernment \n\nSeveral states have registration or disclosure laws that regulate the sale of franchises. Some states have laws meant to protect franchisees after they buy. The FDD should include information about any such laws in your state. If the information isn’t in the FDD, check with your state Attorney General’s office, office of consumer affairs or state securities division.\n\nThe FTC\n\nThe FTC works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair practices in the marketplace and to provide information to businesses to help them comply with the law. To file a complaint or to get free information on consumer issues, visit ftc.gov or call toll-free, 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.

Unfortunately, this time of cheer is often accompanied by excessive spending. This year, when it comes to taking control of holiday spending, start by looking in the mirror.\n\nAccording to an annual survey by Deloitte, spending on gifts accounts for just $554 of the estimated $1,652 that survey respondents indicated they plan to spend over the holidays in 2023. The rest will go to non-gift items—the stuff we buy for ourselves—as well as &quot;experiences&quot; such as entertaining at home and socializing outside the home. In fact, &quot;experiences spending&quot; was anticipated to make up the largest portion of respondents’ holiday spending—$632.\n\nYou might be tempted to play things by ear this holiday season: Only 57 percent of survey respondents said they expected to stay within a fixed budget. But if you’re not careful, these expenses can add up quickly. These four steps can help you set, and keep, a thorough holiday budget.\n\n1. Budget for &quot;self-gifted&quot; items, entertaining and socializing. Holiday sales events—now sometimes spanning entire weeks—have become hard-to-resist shopping opportunities for household and personal expenditures. In Deloitte’s survey, 82 percent of respondents indicated they were planning to shop for non-gift items. Prices might be good, but ask yourself if it’s worth spending the money or incurring credit card debt.\n\nIf you plan to entertain guests or celebrate outside your home during the holidays, be sure to include estimates for these costs in your budget, too. And consider using money management apps to help you stay on budget.\n\n2. Check your holiday list for unnecessary expenses or items that you can purchase at some other time of the year. The goal of this list is to itemize expenses that fall outside of your normal monthly spending so you don't spend too much. While highly promoted sales events might be tempting, many items are available for similar prices in various sales throughout the year, so don’t feel pressure to buy during the holiday season to get a good deal.\n\nIt's also a good idea to designate which items you intend to purchase with cash and which gifts, if any, go on a credit card. This can help you control credit card spending, which can negatively impact your finances long after the end of the holiday season.\n\n3. Compare your list to your regular and out-of-pocket monthly bills, such as mortgage or rent payments, car loans, utilities and expenses like gas and dining out. You can use this as a guide for your holiday budget—allocating the amount you typically spend on meals out toward holiday dinners, for instance. Make sure you’re prioritizing the necessities over seasonal extras. For example, 48 percent of Deloitte survey respondents whose student loan payments restarted this fall said they planned to cut back on holiday expenses.\n\nIf you don't already track your monthly costs, start now. You can use this worksheet to track your spending.\n\n4. Look for ways to save. Now that you can see how you spend—and plan to spend—your money, look for ways to save. Some strategies might be simple, like cutting back on holiday entertainment or decorating costs. You might look for free or low-cost holiday events, try a potluck dinner instead of a catered meal, or propose a “Secret Santa” style gift exchange rather than buying presents for everyone on your list.\n\nThe holiday season is also a good time to review your current cell phone, internet or streaming packages and inquire about special offers that could save you money for many months to come (but be sure to read the fine print).\n\nTaking control of holiday spending is a gift that can pay big dividends in the coming year. If you do well, you can accomplish other financial goals, such as building up your emergency fund or increasing your retirement savings.\n\nRecent Investor Insights\n\nSIM Swapping Risks to Investors\n\nOctober 29, 2024\n\nQuestions Employees Should Ask About Stock Awards\n\nOctober 25, 2024\n\n5 Things to Do to Boost Retirement Savings\n\nOctober 17, 2024\n\nInstitutional Investors and ‘Smart Money’\n\nOctober 15, 2024\n\nKnow Your Risk Tolerance\n\nOctober 09, 2024\n\nView All"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:45:46.459475"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2507]]

However, there are steps you can take to soften the impact of an unexpected hit to your finances. Here are a few tips on how to prepare for and survive financial hardships.  \n\nAdvance Planning\n\nBuild an emergency fund. Setting aside cash ahead of time to cover unexpected expenses can help ease stress when an emergency arises. Keep these funds in a savings account or other safe place where you don’t incur investment risk and can have immediate access to the money if you need it. Three to six months of savings in an emergency fund is a good goal, but putting aside any amount that you can afford is helpful.  \n\nInclude savings in your spending plan. To keep your finances in order, track your monthly income and expenses. Then make saving a part of your budget: Set an amount to be automatically withdrawn from every paycheck or schedule recurring deposits to your savings account. Consider depositing some of these funds into an individual retirement account (IRA) to begin saving for retirement. And if your company offers a retirement plan with a company match, try to contribute at least enough to take advantage of that. Even if you can only set aside small amounts, your savings will add up over time.\n\nMaintain health care coverage. Medical and other related health care costs can quickly spiral out of control if you don’t have health insurance. If you have health insurance through your employer and lose your job, you might be eligible for temporary continuation coverage under COBRA, a federal law that typically entitles you to continue your employer's coverage for 18 to 36 months. Free or discounted health care might also be available through financial assistance programs or under certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. \n\nUse credit wisely. There are times when it makes sense to incur debt. Remember, however, that credit cards’ high interest rates mean balances can grow quickly. Repaying any debt you accumulate needs to be part of your budget planning.\n\nSurvival Mode\n\nAct quickly to reduce spending. If you lose your job or face an unexpected expense, you might have less money available to cover your usual costs. Take immediate action to reduce spending wherever possible. You might need to modify your monthly budget for a while. Consolidating debt, eating out less, taking steps to cut down utility costs, reducing your number of streaming or subscription services, freezing credit cards and switching to less expensive home and car insurance are some potential strategies.\n\nAssess your short-term situation. Figure out how much cash you have readily available or can get on short notice, how much you owe—mortgage, rent, credit cards, car loans—and the monthly payments associated with those debts. Establish how long you can make ends meet on the financial resources you already have.\n\nAsk about dislocated worker services. Your employer may work with state and local officials to provide services such as job placement, retraining or resume writing. If you’ve lost your job, take advantage of these services—make finding a new job your full-time focus. If you belong to a labor union, ask what they can do to assist you.\n\nLook into unemployment insurance. Your state unemployment insurance office can tell you whether you qualify for coverage and how the insurance may be affected if you get other payments from the company. Knowing how much you can claim and how long you can expect to receive unemployment benefits will help you handle your finances. When you file for unemployment insurance, state regulations generally require that you also register with the state's employment service so you can start looking for a job immediately. Be aware that collecting unemployment benefits while working is illegal. You must report the date you begin to work, either full- or part time, to your state’s unemployment office.\n\nExplore social services. If you’re having trouble making ends meet, government benefit programs might be able to help. Contact your local department of human or social services to determine your eligibility for programs that provide assistance with food, housing, health care and child care expenses. If you’re over 65 or caring for an elderly family member, make sure to maximize Medicare and Social Security benefits. You might also want to research local food banks or organizations that supply essentials like hygiene products and diapers and formula.\n\nTake advantage of flexible spending accounts (FSAs): If you’re enrolled in an FSA and the coverage period has begun, consider spending the money while still employed for items or services you know you'll need. While FSA funds typically expire upon termination from a job, IRS rules allow you to withdraw the full amount you elected to contribute once the coverage period begins. If you’ve been reimbursed for more than you’ve contributed at the time of your termination, you don’t have to repay funds that were used on eligible expenses. Check with the IRS for a list of allowable expenses.\n\nTake control of medical bills. Even if you have health insurance, bills from medical emergencies can pile up quickly. If you’re faced with significant medical expenses, ask your provider if you qualify for discounted care. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals are required to offer financial assistance programs to eligible patients. If you don’t qualify, many health care providers offer interest-free or income-based repayment plans. You also might be able to apply for a medical credit card with a zero-interest introductory period, which can give you time to pay down your bill. However, make sure you know when the promotional period ends and what the new interest rate will be so you don’t accumulate high charges on any unpaid balance.\n\nAddress rising rent. Housing makes up a major portion of many people’s budgets, so a jump in these costs can be destabilizing. First look up your local rent control laws, as they vary widely by jurisdiction. Even if there’s no limit on how much rent can increase each year, make sure notice was provided in the time required. Then, see if your landlord is willing to negotiate; if you’ve been a reliable tenant, they might be willing to lower the rate to avoid having to find a new renter. You might ask to sign a longer lease or give up an amenity you’re not using, like an extra parking space.\n\nGet financial advice. During times of financial stress, employer-provided services, state or local employment agencies, credit counselors and financial professionals can serve as valuable sources of information. Working with an investment professional can help you to become a more disciplined saver, better manage your investment risks and avoid potential scams. They can also advise you on how early withdrawals and transfers from your retirement funds might lead to costly tax consequences and penalties that might deplete your savings. Research investment professionals using BrokerCheck.\n\nFinancial duress can make you more vulnerable to both employment scams and financial fraud. Be wary of promises that seem too good to be true, and use FINRA’s Scam Meter to check if a financial pitch carries some of the warning signs of fraud.

This plan reflects our continuing effort to become more transparent to the American public; invite greater public participation in the policies and decisions of this agency; and foster expanded collaboration with our many partners, advocates, and people we serve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nI am proud to lead Social Security’s implementation of President Obama’s Open Government Initiative, and to carry out specific commitments to improve our operations and services in an open and transparent manner. In this plan, you will find a summary of achievements from our first Open Government Plan, as well as several new efforts, including a flagship initiative to deliver Enhanced Services for People Receiving Benefits. The centerpiece of this initiative is the suite of services we now offer at my Social Security, where you can securely and conveniently access valuable personalized Social Security information. We are excited to offer this additional option for doing business with us.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur Open Government Plan 2.0 also outlines our improvement efforts in other major areas, including health information technology, wounded warrior collaboration, and electronic signatures on online disability applications. We also have published 43 datasets on our Open Government Website and Data.gov, with an aim to increase public understanding of our mission, our programs, and the actions we take. We encourage you to review the information on our website and on Data.gov and welcome your thoughts on additional data and information we should make available to the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn putting this refreshed plan together, we sought comments from many sources. We appreciate your continued interest and participation, and welcome your additional insight on ways we can improve our programs and service to you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nPlease follow our progress on the milestones in our plan, and share your thoughts and ideas at open.government@ssa.gov.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThank you,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarolyn W.

We also report on planned actions and commitments contained in our first Open Government Plan. We are pleased to report that we accomplished most of our goals in our original Open Government Plan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSee Appendix A for public and agency involvement in developing our Open Government Plan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTransparency: We are committed to sharing information that helps the public understand our programs and hold us accountable for our performance. We published an inventory of our information and evaluated our processes to release information to the public to ensure we could achieve our transparency objectives while maintaining the privacy of personal information. We will continue to release information in a format the public can use. We submitted datasets to the Federal government's document repository, (Data.gov), and we are incorporating feedback on those datasets as we publish additional information. While we strive to be open and transparent, we must protect vigilantly the personal information the public entrusts to us. We will ensure that transparency does not put that information at risk.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nParticipation and Collaboration: We will continue to expand on our long history of public participation and collaboration. Our open government communications activities include potential tools and tactics for both external and internal audiences. We will continue to offer opportunities for participation on our open government website (SSA.gov/open) and will report there on ideas we receive and progress we make. We will also use our agency Internet site (SSA.gov) to share information and provide opportunities for participation and collaboration. To encourage employee collaboration and innovation across the country, we are creating the necessary infrastructure to support existing and emerging web technologies. We will continue to expand the use of social media tools to discuss our programs and services.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInternalize Open Government Principles: Our Office of Open Government is responsible for coordinating and managing open government initiatives. Our Open Government Executive Steering Committee provides guidance on overall strategic direction. We used open government approaches to develop our new Agency Strategic Plan (ASP) for 2013-2016--just one example of how we are using open government principles. We plan to continue an array of communications activities to foster culture change and promote open government principles in our workforce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFlagship Initiative and Other Major Projects: This plan includes a flagship initiative, Enhanced Services for People Receiving Benefits, and three major projects: Health Information Technology (Health IT), Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER)/Wounded Warrior Collaboration, and eAuthorization (to obtain information in connection with filing an application for disability). These projects support our agency mission, goals, and objectives, and showcase the value of open government.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nNOTE: For your convenience, at the end of this plan, we have included a glossary of certain technical or agency-specific terms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nMission and Goals\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur Agency Mission: Deliver Social Security services that meet the changing needs of the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur Open Government Mission: Support the agency's core mission through the principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur Open Government Goals:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGoal I: Improve transparency\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGoal II: Expand participation\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGoal III: Increase collaboration\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGoal IV: Internalize open government principles\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nImplement one flagship and three major open government initiatives\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWho We Are and What We Do: We run two of the nation's largest entitlement programs: the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. In FY 2011, we paid more than 60 million people a total of about $770 billion. In addition, we assist people in applying for food stamps and Medicare, including subsidies for the Medicare Prescription Drug Program.

We continue to fully support Data.gov by updating and releasing information as it becomes available (releases include data on service, Social Security's programs, and statistical information).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe completed a Data Inventory and Release Plan outlining steps for releasing future datasets.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe established our social media presence, launching agency YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter accounts. We also set up Spanish-language Facebook and Twitter accounts. We recently expanded our social media use; therefore, we have established a social media board to oversee the creation and posting of daily messages on our Facebook and Twitter sites.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe launched our first public video contest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe hosted a webinar broadcast for college students and young workers: &quot;Social Security 101: What's in it for me?&quot;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe aired a Spanish webinar in February 2012 featuring an overview and interactive session regarding our Spanish Retirement Estimator and online applications for retirement, Medicare, and Extra Help with Medicare prescription drug plan costs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe have ensured our new online engagement and collaboration tools are accessible to people with disabilities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThree Flagship Initiatives Launched\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe launched our online Spanish Retirement Estimator, our first non-English online service. We further expanded Spanish online services when we launched the Spanish iClaim, the online application for Social Security retirement, disability, and Medicare benefits, and the Spanish i1020, the online application for extra help with Medicare prescription drug plan costs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe unveiled a new service-channeling (Online Service Enhancement) tool to help people more easily find the information and services on our website.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe published an online Life Expectancy Calculator - another tool to help people plan for retirement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSee Appendix C for a status of the three flagship initiatives in our 2010 plan.

And now, we must build on that progress.&quot;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n--President Barack Obama, September 23, 2010\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSocial Security will meet the open government principle of transparency through information sharing and accountability.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to provide information to the public to increase their understanding of our mission, our programs, and the actions we take. While we currently share significant amounts of non-personal information through a number of outlets and methods, there is ever-growing public demand for more information and clarity in our processes. We share the President's commitment to make non-personal information known, and have taken steps to make more information available electronically.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOn February 6, 2010, we launched our open government portal, where the public can find datasets and information about our overall management and organizational structure. The public may also use this website to contact us and submit comments and ideas. This avenue is one of several we use to get input about information the public wants. See Goals II and III below for more detail about our participation and collaboration activities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe continue to update and expand the information available from this portal, which is an important tool in our efforts to further transparency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFor more information about our involvement in Federal transparency initiatives (Data.gov, eRulemaking, Information Technology Dashboard, Recovery.gov, USAspending.gov, and declassification program) see Appendix D. Appendix G describes our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) program and how we are ensuring transparency through a presumption of openness4.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 1: Provide high-value information that meets the public's needs while protecting privacy and ensuring security of personal information\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe compiled an inventory of our high-value information and developed a schedule of information and datasets for release to the public. As of August 2012, we had released 40 datasets to Data.gov. We delayed several datasets due to resource limitations, additional reviews of disclosure requirements, and data availability issues. Based on our reviews, and the feedback received through the portal, other feedback methods, FOIA requests, and Data.gov, we will identify additional information to release in future years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur Open Government Executive Steering Committee oversees this ongoing review. Our Data.gov point of contact manages the review on a day-to-day basis along with a working group made up of experts in enterprise architecture, data quality, privacy, and security along with agency data stewards. The working group members participate in architectural reviews, tool selection, data mining workgroups, and in the development of data standards to advance open government and open data concepts throughout the agency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are working to release new high-value datasets and information holdings. See Appendix E for a list of anticipated releases for 2012-2014. View the list of datasets we have released to date. We are also making this process more efficient. To this end, we are incorporating data transparency considerations into the system development lifecycle so we can automate the release of data in standard formats.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n&quot;High-value&quot; Defined\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHigh-value information is information that can contribute to increased agency accountability and responsiveness; improve public knowledge of the agency and its operations; further the core mission of the agency; create economic opportunity; or respond to need and demand as identified through public consultation. (OMB Memorandum M-10-06, December 8, 2009).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe strive for transparency in our employment support for individuals receiving disability benefits and provide information to help them make decisions about attempting to work. We hold online Work Incentive Seminar Events, which can be accessed by beneficiaries 24/7. We post an online Employment Network (EN) report card offering comparative information on the various services ENs provide and the different results beneficiaries achieve with their support. Using this information, we believe beneficiaries can better compare ENs in their area. We also are developing a similar tool to help beneficiaries evaluate their State Vocational Rehabilitation Agency services. Finally, we explain in plain language the purposes and expectations of the Ticket to Work (TTW) program to beneficiaries through an open letter, webinars and other means, enabling them to better decide if they should participate in the program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are also:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEvaluating our processes to ensure that the information and data we release are shareable, searchable, accurate, machine readable, and appropriate for release;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMaintaining Disclosure Review Boards to protect privacy by ensuring that no one can use the data we release to identify individual people;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEstablishing annual action plans to update and release data, in accordance with our strategic planning initiatives and within resource constraints;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nConsidering smart disclosure and unstructured information as we develop future data release schedules; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nExploring the expanded use of social media to improve transparency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 2: Provide information to the public in an electronic format\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe continue to identify and release in an electronic format high-value data that were not previously available to the public. The data releases will conform to the standards of Data.gov and the Information Quality Act.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSocial Security's Office of Research, Evaluation, and Statistics is modernizing the production of our statistical publications. In addition to using a new, efficient, and automated business process to produce statistical tables, the modernization initiative will allow us to make some of the low-level aggregated datasets that we use to produce the statistical tables available for public use. These new types of datasets will allow users to generate their own custom statistical information. Providing opportunities for data &quot;mash-ups,&quot; applications, visualizations, and public analysis promotes openness and clearly articulates our commitment to the open government vision of enhancing accessibility and creativity in public use of high-value data.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn addition, we will:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nProvide underlying data as permitted, considering the mosaic effect of multiple data releases throughout government;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nUpdate data, as available and as appropriate; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nContinue to use electronic messages to inform key audiences (stakeholders) such as advocacy groups, data users, other public and private sector organizations, and members of the public of the available information.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSocial Security\nCommitted to Excellence in Accessibility\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are committed to making our entire Internet and Intranet content accessible to all persons with disabilities. As a leader in the Federal Government in the area of accessibility, we have made great progress with our public-facing websites and our Information Technology procurements to ensure that the public has access to our services and that our employees with disabilities have the tools and information they need to do their jobs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWith the development of new web-based technologies, we face additional challenges and opportunities in ensuring accessibility. We remain committed to ensuring that our online documents, multimedia, social media, and videos comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFor additional details about our accessibility policy and resources for people with disabilities, please view SSA.gov/accessibility.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe support and comply with the requirements of Data.gov, eRulemaking, IT Dashboard, Recovery.gov, and USAspending.gov. See Appendix D for information about each of these activities. We work with other agencies to release data jointly, when appropriate. For instance, we participated in Data.gov working groups covering such topics as health and disclosure. Going forward, we will continue to consult with the Federal leadership working under the purview of the CIO Council on information sharing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 3: Inform the public about significant planned actions supporting transparency\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to employ many different communication tools and approaches to support transparency (as well as the other open government principles). One primary communication vehicle is our open government portal. You will find a summary of our communications actions in Appendix F.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to participate in meetings internally and externally to explain the data we post on Data.gov. We will continue to consult with research firms and peers (e.g., military, private, non-profit) who specialize in business intelligence and information management to benchmark best practices for data inventories and quality assurance. We also will reach out to members of the research community, such as academia, to understand research needs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe held a series of face-to-face meetings with advocacy organizations, during which we solicited feedback about the data and information they want us to make available. We will continue these outreach meetings and continue participating in national meetings such as library associations and national disability advocate conferences. Based on the feedback we receive, we will publish additional information and evaluate satisfaction levels and use. We also will continue to monitor outcomes related to new applications and new uses of the data.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 4: Provide information to the public on internal management areas\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn our efforts to be more transparent, we will release more than statistical data, focusing on the broader definition of &quot;high-value&quot; information under open government guidance. We will provide members of public with information they request either through the FOIA process or through other means, such as our outreach with stakeholders. We also will provide information that shows the results of our programs, release data about internal management processes, and provide information relevant to decisions people make in their lives.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe comply with FOIA requirements, records management obligations, and respond to congressional requests. The following sections provide information on internal management of these areas.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are committed to improving our openness by sharing with the public information about our programs and projects. We believe our FOIA program strongly reflects this commitment. Our Office of Privacy and Disclosure (OPD), a major component of the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), directs all FOIA matters within the agency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn FY 2011, Social Security responded to 32,445 FOIA requests. Our response timeframes are significantly better than most other large Federal agencies. Furthermore, we reduced our backlog by 55 percent from FY 2010. At the end of FY 2011, our backlog consisted of 38 pending requests, which represents 0.1 percent of our total FOIA workload.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDuring Sunshine Week 2012, Attorney General Eric Holder recognized us for our exemplary efforts in implementing the Attorney General's FOIA guidelines. We participated with Attorney General Holder in a Department of Justice event that showcased our FOIA accomplishments over the past year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSSA FOIA Staff, from left to right: Jasson Seiden, David Lu, Melanie Ann Pustay (DOJ), Tony West (DOJ), Stacy Rodgers, Carolyn Colvin (SSA Deputy Commissioner), Eric Holder (Attorney General, DOJ), Mona Finch, Dawn Wiggins, Patricia Bellamy, Dan Callahan, Anthony Tookes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are conducting market research to identify software that may provide greater functionality for our FOIA program. As part of our research, we are evaluating technology that other Federal agencies are developing or using that would allow us to update automatically our FOIA reading room with appropriate information at the same time we release the information to the requestor. We anticipate examining alternatives to our current automated FOIA support system by the third quarter of FY 2013.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn the interim, we are updating our systems and our public FOIA website to improve public access to our information. We are redesigning the content, navigation, look, and feel of our public-facing FOIA website. We expect to begin testing a prototype in the third quarter of FY 2012 and will implement the redesign in the 2nd quarter of FY 2013. We will continue to update our existing web-based FOIA Reading Room with information most requested by the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nYou may find more information about our FOIA organization, how we process FOIA requests, and initiatives underway to improve our FOIA program in Appendix G. You also may find more detailed information about our FOIA program at SSA.gov/foia.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nRecords Management\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur Office of Budget, Finance, and Management maintains and oversees agency policies, responsibilities, and procedures for the orderly disposition of our records. These policies include governance of vital records and e-mail retention. For comprehensive information about the agency records management program, visit SSA.gov/open/our-records-management-program.html. This site contains information about the agency records management program, including scheduling all electronic records for retention and destruction and ensuring timely transfer to the National Archives.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nLegislation and Congressional Relations\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur website's home page includes a section called &quot;Information for Congress.&quot; However, much of the information in this section contains information that is of interest to the public, as well.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThis site includes agency testimony before Congress, information about pending Social Security-related legislation, legislative proposals and reports we have sent to Congress, and histories of significant recent legislation affecting Social Security programs. We post testimony and legislation during the current Congress separately from testimony and legislation for prior Congresses (back to the 106th Congress) so that the most recent information is quick and easy to find. Program resources, such as fact sheets, links to actuarial cost estimates for solvency proposals, and links to budget information are available here as well.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn addition to our ongoing effort to update the site continuously with the most recent reports and Congressional activity relating to Social Security programs, as time and resources permit, we will continue building our online repository of materials that may be of interest either for historical reasons or to promote transparency. For example, this year we expanded the ‘“Other Materials for Congress” section to include additional reports to Congress, many of which pertain to internal management procedures, and we have added additional packages from prior years to the ‘“Legislative Proposals Sent to Congress” section.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nCongressional Requests\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe receive congressional inquiries by phone, letter, fax, and via the Internet. The inquiries generally involve constituent - related Social Security cases, program policies, or requests for program or agency information. These inquiries most often come into the Office of the Commissioner, local Social Security field offices, State Disability Determination Offices, and our Office of Legislation and Congressional Affairs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn most cases, the office that receives the initial inquiry can fully address the questions raised and provide a response to the congressional office. No matter which office handles it, our program experts thoroughly research and respond to all congressional inquiries.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGoal II: Expand Participation\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n&quot;We're also soliciting the best ideas from our people in how to make government work better.&quot;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n--President Barack Obama, September 2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to invite the public to participate with us in open government. We greatly benefit from their ideas and opinions. For example, when we consider adding diseases to our Compassionate Allowances initiative5 we have held public hearings to gather information from medical experts, advocates, and individuals interested in the disability process. We use the valuable information and opinions we receive in the forums and other outreach venues to inform our policy decisions. Similarly, when we update the medical listings we use to adjudicate disability claims, we publish an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to get ideas from the public before we begin to draft the proposed regulatory changes. We want to expand on the successes we have achieved and further infuse participation principles into the way we develop policy, solve problems, and determine public preferences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are developing social media policies and instituting practices to use new technologies to support participation and collaboration. As we gain experience and get feedback from stakeholders, we will continue to refine these policies, expand practices, and integrate the tools into our mainstream processes.\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 1: Provide the public with easy and visible access to existing participatory processes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDuring our original open government dialogue, we received many ideas about information we should add to SSA.gov. Much of the requested information was already present on our website but some reported it was difficult to find; so we highlighted the links to this information on our Open Government page. In addition, based on the open government dialogue, we posted a &quot;top ideas&quot; list, reflecting public votes and comments on ideas submitted. The list displays the status of our progress on investigating each idea. We will update our progress on these ideas and any others we received during our development of this revised open government plan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to offer the public easy access through a variety of channels. One of our newer channels is webinars. In the last few years, we hosted more than 25 of these interactive web events on such topics as retirement planning, applying online for disability benefits, online business services, and benefits for young workers. Our webinar entitled, “Social Security 101: What’s in it for me?,” received the first place Gold Screen Award in the webcast category from the National Association of Government Communicators, a nonprofit professional network of Federal, State, and local government employees. The Gold Screen Award recognizes superior government communication products.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSSA &quot;101 Webinar Team&quot;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFrom left to right: Dawn Bystry, Darlynda Bogle, Brian Simpson, Jennifer Lohr (NAGC President), Mayela Gillette\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThis year, we also hosted our first-ever Spanish webinar to inform the Hispanic community about several new online services offered in Spanish.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nRecordings of webinars with current content are posted on our agency website. Our recorded webinars have received more than 153,000 views to date.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOther participatory efforts we plan to continue include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nInforming the public when we adopt an idea submitted through our collaboration and participation engagements. We will post feedback at SSA.gov/open with continued opportunities for participation;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nProviding notice of opportunities for public participation, such as our interactive webinars;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nProviding information about other means to provide feedback on various topics related to our programs and services;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nProviding the public with an opportunity to comment on our proposed regulations at www.regulations.gov, our eRulemaking initiative; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nUsing focus groups for public input and employing usability testing with members of the public before launching online services.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe currently provide the public with an opportunity to comment on our public use forms and information collection requests, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) through email at ^OR.Reports.Clearance@ssa.gov. (View a complete list of our data collection projects.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCompassionate Allowances\nParticipation and Collaboration in Developing Disability Policy\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSince 2007, Social Security has collaborated with the public, the National Institutes of Health, Alzheimer's Association, National Organization for Rare Disorders, and the agency's own expert medical staff, to determine which medical conditions to include in the Compassionate Allowance process. Compassionate Allowances are a way of quickly identifying diseases and other medical conditions that are so serious that they obviously meet our disability standards, based on minimal objective medical information. This expedited process has already helped about 100,000 people with severe disabilities get benefit decisions within days instead of months or years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe have held seven Compassionate Allowances public outreach hearings. The hearings focused on rare diseases, cancers, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke, early-onset Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, schizophrenia, cardiovascular disease and multiple organ transplants and autoimmune diseases. In 2008, we developed the initial list of 50 Compassionate Allowance conditions based on information we received at public outreach hearings, public comments on an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, input from the Social Security and Disability Determination Service (DDS) communities, and the advice of medical and scientific experts. We continue to increase the number of conditions identified as Compassionate Allowances. On April 11, 2012, Commissioner Astrue announced 52 new Compassionate Allowances conditions, taking the list of conditions from 113 to 165. The conditions became effective on August 11, 2012. One of our lead executives received the 2011 Service to America Medal for leading development of the Compassionate Allowances initiative.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFor more information on our Compassionate Allowances process, visit SSA.gov/compassionateallowances.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe recently announced the Disability Determination Process Small Grant program that will make small stipends available to graduate students for innovative research relevant to our disability program, including the Compassionate Allowances initiative. We awarded an approximately $1.5 million grant over a five-year period to Policy Research Incorporated to manage the student stipend process and to fund the stipends. In early 2012, SSA awarded the first grants to eight graduate students for research on a variety of disability topics, including improvements to the Compassionate Allowances program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 2: Provide new and easier methods for public engagement throughout the agency decision-making processes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe tested a variety of Web 2.0 technologies with different segments of our user community. Based on this testing, we are establishing a robust, integrated enterprise collaboration platform as a &quot;software-as-a-service&quot; (SaaS) cloud solution. This solution will provide a consistent look and feel across the technologies and deliver a superior experience for collaboration and participation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are using social media tools to engage audiences in discussions about our strategic planning, programs, and services. When we developed our new Agency Strategic Plan, we used an idea-sharing tool to capture public input and feedback during development.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are interested in gathering and incorporating public input on our plans to revise outdated medical listings. We plan to test an idea-generating tool to gather ideas from the public before the Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) stage of the policy development process. This tool allows the public to submit ideas, review ideas submitted by others, and rank their importance through voting. We will gauge the level of public participation as well as the type of information users submit. We will also assess the value of adding this step in front of the ANPRM process and the impact of this added step on our workload.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGoal III: Increase Collaboration\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn our first two years of implementing open government, we made progress in reaching out to collaborate with external organizations in support of public service and greater openness across government. We want to expand on this progress through additional collaborative efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 1: Improve collaboration with Federal and non-Federal government agencies, the public, and non-profit and private entities\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to build innovative partnerships and use technology to improve collaboration within and outside the agency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHere are just a few examples of our collaboration efforts:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBased on an employee suggestion, we participated in a collaboration project with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to determine whether we could use some of the school's medical research to streamline disability case decisions. This collaboration provided our first efforts at applying &quot;natural language processing&quot; to disability claims adjudication. While the project was very limited in scope, it provided some promising early findings and should be useful as we integrate Health Information Technology (health IT) into our disability process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTo improve access to and understanding of our programs, we continue to conduct programmatic seminars with Indian tribes, provide benefits publications to tribal benefit specialists, and develop training guides for distribution to third parties who work with these communities. We also installed over 20 video service delivery terminals on reservations throughout Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, and Texas. These remote service locations provide a convenient way to file for benefits and access other critical agency services.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe worked with Medicare advocates to develop and refine the Extra Help application for the Medicare Prescription Drug program. In particular, the advocates provided insight for refining specific questions on the application to make it easier to understand. We also interviewed prospective Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries to determine how to change the language in the application. We conducted 30 interviews in English and nine in Spanish to pinpoint the language issues; we will use this input to change the wording of one of the questions on the application form. The online application is among the highest rated in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), scoring 90 (or third among government online transactions) in the second quarter of 20126.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 2: Collaborate with others to provide new and easier methods for public and employee engagement during agency decision-making processes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn addition to expanding our engagement with the public, we also are committed to increasing employee participation and we will build a modern infrastructure necessary to support such efforts. We will collaborate with appropriate offices to begin using and offering these tools internally, and as we gain experience, we will expand them for public use as appropriate.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn an effort to foster collaboration, avoid duplication, and retain organizational knowledge, we are initiating a partnership with the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) to provide an integrated cloud-based collaboration platform for select subject matter experts as part of our Shared Service strategy. We expect to have the collaboration platform operational by December 2012.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur use of a tool called IdeaCAT is one example of how we are collaborating to improve openness to new ideas, employee satisfaction, ownership, and overall customer service. The IdeaCAT team was one of the first recipients of SSA’s Open Government Honor Award.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIdeaCAT\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe launched IdeaCAT in September 2010 based on lessons learned from the collaborative development of the Electronic Claims Analysis Tool (eCAT), a tool to document the analysis of a disability case. IdeaCAT is a web-based, crowd-sourcing tool that allows users to submit ideas for enhancements to the eCAT tool. IdeaCAT allows users to vote and comment on the ideas that others submit. This tool helps prioritize actions to improve eCAT.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe entire IdeaCAT process is transparent because the IdeaCAT team provides feedback and status on comments via its web page and regular newsletters. In addition, it posts all comments without moderation, permitting the user community to &quot;police&quot; the discussion if necessary.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe user community has actively participated in the process, with over 700 employees registered to use the tool. Since implementing IdeaCAT, more than 120 users have submitted 414 new ideas. Users have cast over 5,000 votes for these ideas. The IdeaCAT team has incorporated 51 ideas into eCAT.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThrough further collaboration, the team is developing a robust, supportable, web-based tool - known as the electronic Bench Book (eBB) - for hearing offices to use to help standardize and document the hearing decision process and outcome. When it is released, eBB will include a similar tool to collect ideas for system enhancements.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe IdeaCAT team continues to look for new opportunities to introduce other tools and to support open government principles throughout the agency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGoal IV: Internalize Open Government Principles\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are committed to becoming an even more open and transparent organization. However, we must balance this goal with our need to protect the sensitive and personal information we use to administer our critical programs. The principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration require us to approach our jobs in new ways and learn to think about service in new terms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGoal IV provides governance structures to oversee these new approaches and plans for changing the culture of the agency so that we internalize open government values and principles throughout our workforce. These principles support our longstanding values of providing good service and safeguarding the personal information we maintain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 1: Foster employee engagement in open government initiatives and work toward culture change by infusing open government values and principles throughout the agency\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will implement open government changes and infuse these new principles and values into our business processes. Our efforts will be comprehensive and continuous.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFor example:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe announced the launch of our open government portal to all employees, and we incorporated employee suggestions into our Open Government Plan. We will continue to seek and adopt employee feedback in implementing this refreshed plan;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will share our Open Government Plan 2.0 with all employees on the agency Intranet and send them periodic updates about the plan and our open government activities;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to provide our employees with easy access to open government materials on our Intranet site;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will incorporate open government principles into appropriate training activities for employees. We will monitor and collect feedback on the training and make adjustments as needed;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOur open government communications activities will include specific actions to involve employees; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to encourage employee participation to develop new tools and improve work processes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOpen Government Honor Award\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn June 2012, two teams received SSA’s inaugural Open Government Honor Award - one for its achievements in participation and collaboration, and the other in transparency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe IdeaCAT team received the Open Government Honor Award based on its actions to enhance the quality of the electronic Case Assessment Tool (eCAT). In an environment of strained budgets and reduced staffing, the team worked creatively to find a collaborative solution to improve the eCAT, by drawing on the knowledge and expertise of the many users across the agency and in the State disability determination services. The success of the team’s work is evident in the level of participation and the number of suggested improvements we have been able to incorporate into eCAT. The IdeaCAT team used the same approach to develop another collaboration tool that will be available later in 2012 to support hearings offices. The team continues to explore other opportunities to engage both employees and external partners.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe second award-winning team, the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review’s (ODAR) Data.gov group, led the way in publishing a large number of high-value datasets. These datasets, which provide statistics and other information about our disability appeals process, received more views and downloads than any of our other open government data releases. The datasets reflect the true value of public data, fostering use that leads to greater agency accountability and responsiveness and increased public knowledge of the agency and its operations. Going forward, the ODAR Data.gov team plans to expand its public data offerings to include appeals and court data.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOpen Government Honor Award Recipients\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIdeaCAT Team\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIdeaCAT Team, from left to right: Debi Gardiner, Eric Estes, Gale Nicholson, Chuck Wansor, Brandy Mershon, and Brittny Thompson\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nODAR Data.gov Team\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nODAR Data.gov team, from left to right: Shenghui Yang, Charles Gramens, Darrell Rapier, Jaunice Kennedy, and Diana Shelton. Not pictured: Debra Castel and Aaron Hugeback\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 2: Incorporate open government principles into the way we organize and do our work\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Commissioner and top executives provide overall guidance through senior operations meetings. To understand the executive leadership functions of Social Security, see the agency organization in Appendix H, Chart 1.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHighlights of actions related to organizational support for open government include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Office of Open Government in the Office of Communications coordinates all open government initiatives for the agency. See Appendix H, Chart 2 for the organization chart of the Office of Communications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Commissioner created an Open Government Executive Steering Committee to direct the agency's open government activities. This group will continue to look for ways to instill open government principles into agency practices, processes, and policies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Commissioner appointed an executive to be accountable for the quality and objectivity of Federal spending information. See Appendix H, Chart 3.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Executive Internal Control Committee serves as the agency Senior Management Council that oversees internal controls, including those controls covering data quality.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe also support open government through internal processes and systems. Some examples include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOur user-centered design (UCD) process is a key component of our System Development Lifecycle. We use UCD processes to ensure a high level of usability for new services we make available online to the public or to our employees. We elicit business and user needs and then follow an iterative cycle of design and usability testing to achieve measurable goals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are leveraging our data, modern analytical tools, and data warehousing technologies to help us make decisions. These tools have improved the quality of, consistency of, and access to the information needed by executives, managers, and analysts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 3: Align open government activities with our mission and strategic goals\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe released our Agency Strategic Plan (ASP) for 2013-2016 in February 2012. In developing our new plan, we incorporated open government principles in how we perform many of the major activities. Furthermore, the Information Resources Management Strategic Plan (IRM Plan), released in May 2012, includes the technology framework for supporting our open government efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHighlights of actions to foster alignment between agency mission, strategic goals, and major agency efforts and the open government initiative include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAppendix B, which shows examples of the open government initiatives' support of the mission, objectives, and current agency goals\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAlignment of the Information Resources Management Plan (IRM Plan) with open government principles and initiatives, including technical support for open government by:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEnhancing SSA’s audit trail and integrity review processes to ensure they evolve to meet our changing business processes and data storage needs;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nImproving our oversight of State and Federal organizations and partners requesting or currently receiving our information; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nContinuing to support mobile computing and prepare for further consumerization of technology and security.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSocial Security's open government flagship and major initiatives - Enhanced Services for People Receiving Benefits (flagship), and three major projects: Health Information Technology, Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record(VLER)/Wounded Warrior Collaboration, and eAuthorization (for disclosure of information in connection with filing an application for disability). These projects support the mission, objectives and goals of the agency, and showcase the value of open government principles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 4: Provide public access to our open government performance measures and results\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will provide information about open government measures and results. For example:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will post our open government goals and our performance against the goals on our website.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will review our Agency Performance Plan (APP) to incorporate open government principles and activities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to evaluate results of open government initiatives to understand possible relationship to the achievement of results.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will monitor and continue to develop ways to measure the benefits from open government activities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to monitor FOIA requests to identify additional information holdings of high value to the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will track our efforts in engaging the public and employees by the volume of calls for information and data. Goodwill created by open government activities may result in higher use of electronic services by the public and higher levels of satisfaction for those who transact business with us online.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nObjective 5: Support the transfer of open government ideas, tools, and other materials\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are a Federal leader in the use of health IT. Our work with the private sector may yield transferable ideas and tools. We will share our results and products from health IT and from other innovative endeavors as appropriate. Other examples of potential transferable ideas and tools stemming from our innovation efforts include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe continue to look for opportunities to use federally developed open-source solutions in our business applications. We continue to deploy open-source solutions such as rules engines, enterprise service bus, and business process modeling into our programmatic applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe introduced governance processes and review boards to ensure that we maximize our use of open-source software where appropriate. Those processes also drive our project teams to use our own adaptation of an internal open-source community - a framework of reusable JAVA classes that provide common application functionality. We will continue our efforts to adopt this framework, which allows for the creation of standardized applications and avoids duplication of development effort.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe continue to explore managed content solutions (Web Content Management Systems) that will help us promote a shared environment for our content and the code behind it. The separation of these basic elements speeds required maintenance and comports with current best practices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are partnering with the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), an agency of the Department of Commerce, to provide us with a cloud-based collaboration environment as part of our Shared Services strategy. This collaboration environment will allow us to consolidate a variety of solutions that the agency has developed and deployed, and which allow for a single integrated environment for select subject matter experts to collaborate and share knowledge and ideas.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe look forward to sharing the products of our open-source platform efforts across the growing Federal open-source development community, as well as partnering with other agencies in future endeavors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to actively participate in cross-government workgroups and share best practices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe also plan to:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nShare materials we develop for open government implementation; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCollaborate extensively with public and private partners.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSection III: Open Government Flagship and Major Initiatives\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEach of the initiatives in this section supports at least one of the open government principles, furthering our efforts in improving transparency, participation, or collaboration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFlagship:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEnhanced Services for People Receiving Benefits\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo make our services even more accessible, we will consolidate our existing online services into a single &quot;gateway,&quot; which will use a robust and easy-to-use authentication process to safeguard personal identity information. We also plan to provide a common online user experience that is flexible enough to meet the needs of our broad customer base. Our goal is to enable expanded use of our online services and to make those services easy to use. Because we complete over 100 million actions to keep beneficiaries' records current each year, we want to offer those people who can help themselves a convenient way to do so.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe provided online access to some of our services for many years, and the demand and usage continue to grow. In FY 2011, people used our electronic services to check benefit information over 2.5 million times, submit change of address information more than 400,000 times, and submit changes to direct deposit information more than 190,000 times. As the Internet increasingly becomes the preferred method of conducting business, we are committed to further enhancing our online services for the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEnhancing services for people receiving benefits is a key feature of Social Security's Customer Service Plan (CSP). As we build the gateway to services, we will use participatory tools and approaches to evaluate its impact and benefit. We will collaborate with industry experts and conduct usability testing with the public. Members of the public, as well as our employees, will provide important insight through our online dialogue and submission of comments and suggestions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are working on a new, more secure protocol to authenticate people who are interested in conducting their business online. It is a gateway to allow members of the public online access to their personal information; the first service using the new authentication process is the online Social Security Statement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe online statement promotes transparency by providing information the public finds useful for financial and retirement planning. Specifically, the online Statement provides:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEstimates of the retirement and disability benefits a person may receive;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEstimates of benefits a family may receive when a person receives Social Security or dies;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA list of lifetime earnings according to Social Security’s records;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe estimated Social Security and Medicare taxes paid;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nInformation about qualifying and signing up for Medicare;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThings to consider for those age 55 and older who are thinking of retiring;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGeneral information about Social Security; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA printable version of the Social Security Statement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are working on a variety of other secure, personalized online services for the public, such as checking the status of a benefit application, receiving notices, and requesting certain routine actions, such as a change of address.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will use surveys and web analytics to evaluate the impact of this initiative and to identify future enhancements. This initiative is a key part of our growing suite of online services, and we will improve it as necessary to meet the changing needs of the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe also hope to implement the following activities over the next two years:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBy the end of 2012: rollout our new, more secure user ID protocol and online Social Security Statement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBy the end of FY 2013: add new services behind the new user ID protocol. We are first focusing on existing beneficiary services, such as change-of-address, direct deposit, benefit verification, and check-your-benefit-status.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFollowing are other actions we plan to carry out in support of our flagship initiative to enhance services for people receiving benefits:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCollect feedback to measure customer satisfaction and identify opportunities for improvement. (Ongoing)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nExplore new survey tools and approaches to provide more timely and detailed customer feedback. (FY 2013 and ongoing)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEstablish, communicate, and use customer service metrics and standards\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEstablish and use customer service standards, including customer success rates, to manage the testing and deployment of our enhanced online services. (FY 2013 and ongoing)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nContinue to use customer service metrics for all of our service channels. For specific metrics, see our APP.

In some cases, eliminate delays associated with postal mail. (FY 2013 and ongoing)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nMajor Initiatives:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHealth Information Technology (IT)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe believe that health IT will reduce the time it takes to obtain the medical records needed to support disability determinations, and will help us manage that information more efficiently.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe developed this initiative based on input from and collaboration between medical associations, health privacy advocates, medical providers and State Agencies. We have collaborated with a limited number of partners to demonstrate the capability to obtain and process medical records more expeditiously using health IT. Health IT fully automates the process for obtaining medical evidence. The amount of time it takes us to complete a disability claim should decrease as the number of treating sources using health IT increases. By the end of FY 2012, we plan to expand the exchange of medical records through health IT to various medical networks and providers in 13 States. In FY 2013, we plan to continue our outreach effort to onboard additional medical providers and connect with Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) on the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN). We will also continue to collaborate with government-wide health IT policy and standards setting advisory panels, workgroups and task forces.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn late June 2012, we partnered with Kaiser Permanente, one of the nation’s largest healthcare providers, to electronically transmit medical records to us, with the appropriate consent.  We request about 70,000 patient files from Kaiser Permanente each year, so this seamless new system will save time and money for both partners and allow us to make faster and more accurate decisions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nVirtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER)/Wounded Warrior Collaboration\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are collaborating with the VA and DoD to improve the transfer of medical information and speed the disability decision process for Wounded Warriors, service members, and veterans. We are using a two-pronged approach to improve health information sharing:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nNear-Term Approach: DoD/Social Security Interim Health Data Sharing Initiative: Under this interim approach, we use existing electronic data share technologies to exchange medical information. We began a pilot of this initiative in August 2011, allowing five Disability Determination Services (DDS) sites to request electronic medical records from all DoD Medical Treatment Facilities with a single request to a centralized DoD site. Based on the results of the pilot, we are planning a nationwide expansion that will be completed by the end of calendar year (CY) 2012.\n\nLong-Term Approach: VLER Initiative and the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN): The second approach to improve medical information sharing involves creating a health IT exchange pilot that uses the NwHIN to provide medical records from DoD and VA to SSA. We plan to begin a pilot in FY 2013. To meet this milestone, DoD and VA will implement solutions to process patient authorizations for the release of protected health information that comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\neAuthorization\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe must review medical evidence to make disability decisions. Our current process for collecting medical evidence uses a signed paper authorization from the applicant. An electronic authorization process supports faster disability decisions, which improves service to the public. With eAuthorization, claimants will be able to complete the online disability application process in a streamlined online session rather than printing, signing, and mailing paper forms to our offices. In early 2010, we began outreach to medical associations, legal groups, health privacy advocates, and medical providers to obtain input on how to improve our authorization process. After receiving positive feedback, we developed an electronic alternative to the current paper process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAs of April 21, 2012, claimants filing online for disability benefits have the option to electronically sign and submit form SSA-827 (Authorization to Disclose Information to the Social Security Administration). In August 2012, we began allowing an electronic authorization signature process for claimants who complete the SSA-827 as part of the online Disability Appeal. We are exploring options for obtaining electronic signatures on the SSA-827s for individuals that file disability claims either in person or over the telephone. In 2013, we will explore alternatives to develop an electronic authorization process for third party filers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe based this initiative on input from and collaboration between medical associations, health privacy advocates, medical providers, and Federal and State Agencies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSee Appendix I for Open Government Plan 2.0 milestones and completions dates through 2014.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nConclusion\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAs we move ahead with our plan to become an even more open agency, we look forward to:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nIncreasing Transparency, by sharing information that helps the public understand our programs and hold us accountable for our performance;\n\nFostering Participation, by offering a variety of channels for multiple audiences to engage in dialogues with us and provide ideas on how we can improve our programs and services; and\n\nFurthering Collaboration, by working with other agencies and organizations to exchange ideas for improving our service to the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFinally, Appendix J contains a list of links to Social Security and other websites related to open government. We encourage you to track our progress on our plan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAppendix A: Public and Agency Involvement in Open Government Plan\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe solicited feedback from both the public and employees as we refreshed our Open Government Plan. Deputy Commissioner Colvin's message to all employees (below) invited input from both agency and State DDS employees. Similarly, we invited the public to submit their ideas for our plan using the online tool on our Open Government portal, and issued an invitation to over 14,000 advocates and interested organizations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe received ideas from various sources, including the online comment tool on our open government portal. Examples of ideas we have incorporated into our plan include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEnhanced Services for People Receiving Benefits\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHealth Information Technology (Health IT)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nVirtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER)/Wounded Warrior Collaboration\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\neAuthorization\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe have reviewed the ideas received from our employees and the public and have referred them to the appropriate offices for consideration.

Two years ago, in response to the President's call for greater openness across government, we published Social Security's first Open Government Plan. In it, we outlined our steps to increase transparency, expand opportunities for public participation, and enhance efforts to collaborate with other organizations to improve service to the public. You have a unique perspective based on the experience and knowledge you have gained administering Social Security's programs and services. We want to benefit from your insight. We will use comments we receive to develop a refreshed plan that can be achieved within our available resources.

Below is a brief summary of each flagship initiative, including evaluation results:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInitiative 1: Spanish Retirement Estimator (S-RE)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDuring our public engagement to develop the 2010 Open Government Plan, we received a suggestion to provide greater access to retirement information. One of the hallmarks of our online retirement planning tools is our online Retirement Estimator, which provides users with instant, personalized estimates of their future Social Security retirement benefits. This popular application has been used millions of times since its launch in 2008 and consistently ranks as one of the top four online Government applications in public satisfaction surveys.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAs part of our commitment to provide services that meet the needs of our nation's diverse population, we developed and implemented this online service in Spanish. We engaged both the public and our employees in developing the S-RE, held public focus groups at various locations around the country, and met with national Hispanic community groups to solicit feedback and suggestions. Internally, employees across the agency assisted in technical development, policy decisions, and translation efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nResults: We released the S-RE on December 12, 2010. This application has provided almost 29,000 retirement estimates with a satisfaction score of 91 on the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) Survey.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInitiative 2: Online Service Enhancement\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe offer our services through a variety of channels. Many of our services are available online at SSA.gov or through our automated telephone systems. People can access other services through our toll-free phone number, 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778). Very few services still require a visit to a Social Security office. People who need to visit an office have the option of scheduling an appointment at a time that is convenient for them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo help the public understand our available service options, we built a new online tool that directs the public to the most appropriate service delivery method for their needs. Through guided search tools, visitors to our website can more readily arrive at the correct service channel, which encourages more people to use our online services. Additionally, individuals who are unable to start a Social Security benefit application online are able to schedule an appointment online with the local field office. As we built this service enhancement, we collaborated with industry experts and conducted usability testing with the public. Members of the public, as well as our employees, provided important insight, participating in our online dialogue and submitting other comments and suggestions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe used surveys and web analytics to evaluate the impact of this initiative and ensure that users could easily find the services they seek.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nResults: We implemented the service enhancement and iAppointment in November 2010. Results show that the average satisfaction score from the ACSI Survey for iAppointment is 78 (very good customer satisfaction).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInitiative 3: Online Life-Expectancy Calculator\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe developed and launched a simple online life-expectancy calculator to assist the public with retirement planning. A key factor in considering retirement options is life expectancy, a factor many people substantially underestimate. The tool draws on actuarial assumptions from the annual Social Security Trustees' report and provides the average number of additional years a person can expect to live when reaching a certain age. We designed it for use with our online Retirement Estimator, which provides users with instant, personalized estimates of their future retirement benefits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nResults: We completed this initiative in July 2010. Results show that the total number of visits to the life expectancy calculator was approximately 430,000 for the period through February 2012. There is no ACSI Survey for this tool to gauge customer satisfaction.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAppendix D: Federal Transparency Initiatives\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n1. Data.gov\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe support the President's agenda for the democratization of data. We added datasets to Data.gov in the past several years in accordance with OMB Memorandum M-10-06.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe are active members of the Data.gov community and work with many other agencies to advance transparency throughout the Federal sector. This work includes, but is not limited to the Security and Privacy Working Group and the Metadata Working Group. These joint efforts help expose new insights in the need for data and provide opportunities for data challenges on the use of data. We are mindful of all such opportunities. We are also aware of the need to provide the data and information in a context that is understandable and displayed through visualization tools that make sense to the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIdeas and Comments from the Public\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe receive ideas and comments from employees and the public about additional datasets and information that they wish to see posted via web portals, idea tools, email, face-to-face meetings, etc. We will continue to use this input, along with executive guidance, in our strategic planning process to ensure that the principle of transparency becomes part of our ongoing operating procedures. It will also continue to inform our ongoing release of datasets and information not previously available to the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n2. eRulemaking\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSocial Security is a partner agency in the eRulemaking initiative known as the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS), (publicly accessible at Regulations.gov). We began working with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the partner agencies in the development of FDMS in June 2004. We and other partner agencies worked with EPA and the contractor to design a user-friendly system where the public can submit comments on pending regulations. We started using FDMS on September 25, 2006.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nStaff members from our Office of Regulations actively serve on several committees in the continued development and modifications to FDMS and the public-facing website, Regulations.gov.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n3. IT Dashboard\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn response to evolving OMB reporting requirements and enhancements to the IT Dashboard, we simplified its processes and procedures for reporting program performance data and ensuring the quality and timeliness of the data. We increased our focus on the initial quality of reports. As a result, while we continue to review at both the program team and program management levels, there are fewer errors to delay processing. In addition, we increased the frequency of our regular updates to Dashboard data in the area of project performance against established performance measures. This change enhanced the accuracy of performance information, project execution data, risks, and all facets of our major IT investment submissions and ensured that Dashboard reporting is as close to real time as possible.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFor more information, visit ITdashboard.gov.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n4. Recovery.gov\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur responsibilities under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) included:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIssuing a one-time payment of $250 to nearly 55 million Social Security beneficiaries and Supplemental Security Income recipients;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDedicating additional resources to the processing of disability and retirement workloads, including establishing health IT data exchanges, and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nReplacing our National Computer Center.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe developed an overall agency-level plan and three program-specific plans. We submitted our ARRA Plans to the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. The Board includes the information in these submissions and reports on the Recovery.gov website. In addition, we submit a Major Communications Report to the Board and OMB on an ad hoc basis, as we release major communications to the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe submit a weekly Financial and Activity Report to the Board and OMB. This report shows the total ARRA obligations and total gross outlays from ARRA passage through the end of the report week, as well as major completed activities and major planned activities for the week of the report. These reports are posted on the Recovery.gov website.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo further transparency, we also post ARRA-related information on our ARRA website and provide links to Recovery.gov, USAspending.gov, and other sites that may be of interest to the public. For more information, visit www.Recovery.gov.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n5. USAspending.gov\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) requires information on Federal awards be made available to the public via a single, searchable website. Accordingly, OMB established the USAspending.gov website.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOMB issued guidelines for reporting spending data to the USAspending website in Memorandum M-09-19, Guidance on Data Submission under FFATA. We are in full compliance with this guidance, and report our contract data and Federal financial assistance payments data.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nContract Data\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOMB M-09-19 requires us to provide contract data to the Federal Procurement Data System Next Generation (FPDS-NG), which posts the data to USAspending.gov. It also requires us to provide a data file containing program source data (i.e., Treasury Account) directly to USAspending.gov via the USAspending Data Submission and Validation Tool (DVST) until USAspending is capable of accepting program source data from FPDS-NG.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFederal Financial Assistance\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOMB M-09-19 requires us to submit grant and assistance payments data using the Federal Assistance Award Data System (FAADS) PLUS format. Federal financial assistance includes grants and assistance payments made under Federal domestic assistance programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFinancial Assistance Awards - Grants\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOur grants management system, GrantSolutions, has FAADS PLUS data compilation and formatting capabilities, and we submit our grants data to USAspending.gov via DSVT.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFinancial Assistance Payments - Mandatory and Entitlement Programs\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOMB M-09-19 requires we report data about our benefit payments to USAspending.gov. We report these data to USAspending.gov in the FAADS PLUS format via DSVT.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOpen Procurement and Vendor Outreach\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn accordance with the guidance contained in Office of Federal Procurement Policy's (OFPP) memorandum entitled &quot;Myth-Busting: Addressing Misconceptions to Improve Communication with Industry during the Acquisition Process&quot; (dated February 2, 2011), we developed and published a formal Vendor Communication Plan. This plan discusses the steps we will undertake to enhance outreach to our industry partners and reduce unnecessary barriers to competition in the procurement process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAdditionally, to further facilitate exchanges with industry and promote internal market research efforts, we created a centralized repository that allows interested vendors to submit capabilities statements and other marketing information to the agency. This tool is a searchable database that will help agency personnel to identify qualified sources of supply and services and to promote exchanges of important procurement information with industry. View guidance on the use of the SSA Vendor Repository.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDeclassification Program\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Open Government Directive requires agencies to publish links to information about their declassification programs. We do not have original classification authority and cannot classify any document or system of record. Therefore, we do not have a declassification program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAppendix E: Open Government Data/Information Planned Releases in 2012-2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nStatistical and Survey Data:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNational Survey of SSI Children and Families\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2006 Earnings file\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nData modernization files-- SSI Blind and Disabled; all SSI recipients (age, sex, Living Arrangement, State Supplement, type of income)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2009 Benefits and Earnings File\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHearings and Appeals Data:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAppeals Council receipts, clearances, and pending\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCourt remands/Appellate remands\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nVolume/percentage of electronic and paper files at the Hearing level\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCourt Case receipts, clearances, and pendings\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOther Data:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMedicare Extra Help Data\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPublic Satisfaction Survey data\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n800# Caller Survey\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nField Office Caller Survey\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nInternet Report Card\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nField Office Visitor Survey\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCard Center Visitor Survey\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHearing Office Visitor Survey\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDDS Net Accuracy Data, by State\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTotal DDS funding by State by fiscal year\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNational-level Disability Processing Time\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHelp America Vote Act data\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAppendix F: Open Government Communications Actions\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continuously engage external and internal audiences about our efforts and results on transparency, participation, and collaboration. Specifically, we will:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEducate and inform external and internal audiences about our open government activities;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCollect ideas and feedback from external and internal sources about ways to improve our openness as well as our programs and services; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nReport on ideas we receive and any progress or action we take on them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will foster the public's use of the information we release, in order to increase public knowledge and promote public scrutiny of agency services. Our activities will include face-to-face meetings, conference appearances, social media, and other electronic participation and collaboration tools.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWe will continue to use our Internet site (www.socialsecurity.gov) as a platform for sharing information and providing opportunities for participation and collaboration with the public. Internally, we will continue to use our internal website as a platform for keeping our employees informed and engaging them in open government ideas and initiatives.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nPotential Tools and Tactics\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nExternal\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIdea tools\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSocial media (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, podcasts, etc.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nElectronic newsletters\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEmail campaign\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWebinars/webcasts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nVideo and slide presentations\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNational conferences and other speaking engagements\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAdvocate and stakeholder meetings\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFocus groups\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSurveys\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMobile applications\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInternal\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nElectronic technology repository for collaboration\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCommissioner's messages (email, video, audio)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nConference phone calls and video teleconferences\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTraining\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPresentations and workshops for upper management\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPresentations for the regional offices and public affairs specialists\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTown hall meetings with employees\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEmployee newsletter and magazine articles\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFocus groups\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSurveys\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAppendix G: FOIA Program\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe employ a &quot;centralized&quot; approach for handling all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to the agency. Our centralized approach fosters uniformity in training, which enhances our ability to apply consistently a presumption of openness in our FOIA decisions and administrative appeal processes. The Office of Privacy and Disclosure (OPD) directs all FOIA activities within the agency, including developing FOIA policies and procedures, establishing national guidelines for handling FOIA requests, publishing the Annual Report on FOIA activities, and reviewing FOIA and Privacy Act requests and appeals to determine the proper disclosure of records. Agency offices support OPD's efforts by providing documents and other information that responds to the incoming FOIA requests. One agency component in the Office of Operations is responsible for responding to all FOIA requests seeking information regarding applications for Social Security cards.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo accomplish our FOIA mission, OPD employs four divisions, including a FOIA and Transparency Division. Each division supports the disclosure needs of specific Social Security Regional Offices. OPD's Organization Chart and regional alignment is located at SSA.gov/foia/OPD_OrgChart.htm. Regional staff may directly consult with the same core set of analysts on disclosure policy and procedure matters, instead of going through a clearinghouse process that randomly assigns inquiries to a &quot;pool&quot; of analysts. This arrangement also allows the OPD analyst to become familiar with privacy and disclosure issues that may be unique to a particular geographic region due to State or local laws, or other influencing factors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHow We Process Requests\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe receive FOIA requests via the Internet, by fax, by email, and through the mail. Visit our Internet submission page, or see our Guide to FOIA page to learn how to make a FOIA request by mail.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe capture all FOIA requests in our electronic Freedom of Information Act (eFOIA) system. We scan and image all paper requests (mail, email, and fax) into eFOIA; requests submitted through our Internet request form go directly into eFOIA. As soon as we enter a request into the system, or a person submits an online request, eFOIA generates an acknowledgement letter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThis letter confirms receipt of the request. It also provides a reference number specifically assigned to the case and supplies a voice mailbox telephone number that the requester can call to inquire on the status of his or her request. OPD maintains a policy of responding to all calls placed to this number within one working day.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe may charge fees to process certain FOIA requests. The eFOIA system provides members of the public with the option to mail in a FOIA request, or to submit their requests and pay the fee online, which accelerates our response and reduces our administrative costs. We strive to handle each request within 20 days from the date we receive it. We process requests under a &quot;first in, first out&quot; basis. However, sometimes it may take us longer depending on the complexity of the request, the amount of records sought, the documents' location, and our workload. A request may require us to seek paper records that we collectively maintain in multiple geographic locations or in archived storage. Prior to releasing records in response to a FOIA request, OPD conducts a thorough internal review to ensure that we apply our privacy and disclosure rules consistently and accurately. The complexity and nature of each request determines the extent of our level of review, which can include input and review by other offices within Social Security.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nImprovement Initiatives\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe continue to improve our ability to respond to Privacy Act and FOIA requests in an accurate and timely manner. We developed a FOIA Process Evaluation Work Group that reviewed all aspects of our FOIA workflow, from the time we receive and log in a request, to the final review before we release documents. The workgroup's recommendations to post procedures on a shared drive for staff, update equipment to improve the intake process, redesign the FOIA tracking worksheet, and pilot a peer review system, will provide better service to the public. You can see the results of our efforts in this area in our Annual Report.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n1. Training\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOPD maintains an in-house FOIA/Privacy Act training program for analysts that focuses on various technical, legal, and &quot;hands-on&quot; issues involved in processing requests. Some of these sessions focus on processing issues that can cause unnecessary delays in responding. This training provides a formal platform to emphasize the importance of presumptive disclosure, to discuss recent disclosures, and to examine new possibilities for additional disclosures.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOPD maintains a strong commitment to encourage and provide staff the opportunity to attend FOIA training from external sources, such as that sponsored by, or in conjunction with, the Department of Justice, university programs, and not-for-profit organizations. OPD continues to provide Privacy Act and FOIA training at an agency level through our biennial Privacy and Disclosure Training Conference.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n2. Technology\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe continue to use technology to enhance our FOIA capabilities. In 2007, we implemented a new browser-based platform (eFOIA) designed specifically to automate much of the workflow for handling Privacy Act and FOIA requests. The system automatically provides people with a letter acknowledging our receipt of their request, while also providing a case tracking number and a telephone number they may call for status inquiries. The eFOIA system has greatly improved our ability to respond to FOIA requests in a timely manner. In FY 2010, we released six updates/changes to the system. We are working on several other technology-related initiatives to improve our web-based FOIA reading room and our electronic FOIA system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nYou may find more information about our FOIA program, including staffing, organizational structure, request process, and planned improvements on our FOIA webpage.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAppendix H:

software, and hardware used in identifying, extracting, and analyzing business data, such as sales revenues by products and/or departments, or by associated costs and incomes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBusiness process modeling - the activity of representing processes of an enterprise, so that the current process may be analyzed and improved.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nClassification authority/classified documents - authority to categorize information or documents held by the government as sensitive and, thereby, restricting access under law or regulation to particular groups of persons.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nCloud computing - the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network (typically the Internet).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nCrowdsourcing - a distributed problem-solving and production process that involves outsourcing tasks to a network of people, also known as the crowd. This process can occur both online and offline. The difference between crowdsourcing and ordinary outsourcing is that a task or problem is outsourced to an undefined public rather than a specific other body.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nData steward - a person that is responsible for maintaining a data element in a metadata registry. A data steward ensures that each assigned data element has clear and unambiguous definition, does not conflict with other data elements in the metadata registry (removes duplicates, overlap etc.), has clear enumerated value definitions, is still being used (remove unused data elements), is being used consistently in various computer systems, has adequate documentation on appropriate usage and notes, and documents the origin and sources of authority on each metadata element.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nData-mine - a process of discovering new patterns from large datasets.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEnterprise architecture - the process of translating business vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating and improving the key requirements, principles and models that describe the enterprise's future state and enable its evolution.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEnterprise collaboration platform - a set of software components and services for the entire organization that enable users to communicate, share information, and work together to achieve common business goals. The core elements of a collaboration platform are messaging (email, calendaring and scheduling, contacts), team collaboration (file synchronization, ideas and notes in a wiki, task management, full-text search), and real-time communication (e.g., presence, instant messaging, Web conferencing, application / desktop sharing, voice, audio and video conferencing).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEnterprise service bus - a software architecture model used for designing and implementing the interaction and communication between mutually interacting software applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) - a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFacebook - a social networking service and website.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFocus group - a form of qualitative research in which a group of people are asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, service, concept, advertisement, idea, or packaging.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHealth Information Technology (health IT or HIT) - provides the umbrella framework for the comprehensive management of health information across computerized systems and its secure exchange between consumers, providers, government and quality entities, and insurers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInformation holding - a generic and all-encompassing term for an organization's data and information in all formats.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInternal control - a process affected by an organization's structure, work and authority flows, people and management information systems, designed to help the organization accomplish specific goals or objectives.

There are two types; human-readable data that is marked up so that it can also be read by machines (examples; microformats, RDFa) or data file formats intended principally for machines (RDF, XML)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nMash-up - a web page or application that uses and combines data, presentation or functionality from two or more sources to create new services.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nMetadata tagging schemas - the vocabularies used to assemble metadata (metacontent) statements, which are typically structured according to a standardized concept using a well-defined metadata scheme, including metadata standards and metadata models. Tools such as controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, data dictionaries and metadata registries can be used to apply further standardization to the metadata.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nMosaic effect - occurs when combinations of data tidbits produce a picture that was not apparent from the individual pieces. This effect is especially an issue when a person's identity or personal information can be &quot;pieced&quot; together from innocuous data elements.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nNationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN, formerly NHIN) - an initiative for the exchange of healthcare information being developed under the auspices of the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOpen-source - Open-source software is computer software that is available in source code; the source code and certain other rights normally reserved for copyright holders are provided under a free software license that permits users to study, change, improve and at times also to distribute the software. Similarly, other kinds of open-source products are provided free to users who are permitted to alter and adapt them to their own needs and purposes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nReading room (or FOIA reading room) - an agency repository of information released (or possibly likely to be requested) under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nRules engine - a software system that executes one or more business rules in a runtime production environment. The rules might come from legal regulation (&quot;An employee can be fired for any reason or no reason but not for an illegal reason&quot;), company policy (&quot;All customers that spend more than $100 at one time will receive a 10% discount&quot;), or other sources. A business rule system enables these company policies and other operational decisions to be defined, tested, executed and maintained separately from application code.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSmart disclosure - the timely release of complex information and data in standardized, machine-readable formats in ways that enable consumers to make informed decisions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSocial media - includes web-based and mobile technologies used to turn communication into interactive dialogue.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSoftware as a service (SaaS) - sometimes referred to as &quot;on-demand software,&quot; is a software delivery model in which software and its associated data are hosted centrally (typically in the (Internet) cloud) and are typically accessed by users using a thin client, normally using a web browser over the Internet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTwitter - an online social networking service and microblogging service that enables its users to send and read text-based posts of up to 140 characters, known as &quot;tweets&quot;.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nUnderlying data - the data that underlies the results and is what is used to create a presentation in condensed form.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nUnstructured information (or Unstructured Data) - refers to information that either does not have a pre-defined data model and/or does not fit well into relational tables. Unstructured information is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make it difficult to understand using traditional computer programs as compared to data stored in fielded form in databases or annotated (semantically tagged) in documents.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nUsability testing - a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nVirtualized environment - the creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a hardware platform, operating system, a storage device or network resources.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nVisualization - the use of computer-supported tools to explore large amount of abstract data. Practical application of information visualization in computer programs involves selecting, transforming, and representing abstract data in a form that facilitates human interaction for exploration and understanding.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWeb 2.0 - a loosely defined intersection of web application features that facilitate participatory information sharing, interoperability, user-centered design, and collaboration on the World Wide Web. A Web 2.0 site allows users to interact and collaborate with each other in a social media dialogue as creators of user-generated content in a virtual community, in contrast to websites where users (consumers) are limited to the passive viewing of content that was created for them. Examples of Web 2.0 include social networking sites, blogs, wikis, video sharing sites, hosted services, web applications, mashups and folksonomies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWeb analytics - the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of internet data for purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWeb content management system - a software system that provides website authoring, collaboration, and administration tools designed to allow users with little knowledge of web programming languages or markup languages to create and manage website content with relative ease. A robust WCMS provides the foundation for collaboration, offering users the ability to manage documents and output for multiple author editing and participation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWeb portal - a web site that brings together information from diverse sources in a unified way.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWeb services - a method of communication between two electronic devices over the web (internet).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWebinar - a service that allows conferencing events to be shared with remote locations. In general, the service is made possible by Internet technologies, particularly on TCP/IP connections. The service allows real-time point-to-point communications as well as multicast communications from one sender to many receivers. It offers information of text-based messages, voice and video chat to be shared simultaneously, across geographically dispersed locations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nYouTube - a video-sharing website, on which users can upload, view and share videos.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEnd Notes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Open-source software is computer software that is available in source code.

I appreciate the opportunity to come here today to discuss the United States General Services Administration’s (GSA’s) role in the Federal Fleet.\n\nThe mission of GSA’s Office of Fleet Management is to deliver safe, reliable, and low cost vehicle solutions that allow Federal agencies to effectively and efficiently meet their missions. The Federal fleet is broken down into three categories of roughly equal size: one-third is owned by GSA and is leased to those entities designated as eligible, a second third is owned and maintained by the United States Postal Service, and the final third is owned and maintained by other Federal agencies. In accordance with the Federal Management Regulation, executive branch agencies are required to purchase non-tactical vehicles through GSA. Accordingly, those vehicles leased to Federal agencies by GSA and those non-tactical vehicles owned and maintained by executive branch agencies are procured from the same GSA contracts.\n\nGSA’s status as a mandatory source for vehicle purchasing guarantees that all Executive agencies leverage the Federal government’s buying power and reduce government-wide administrative costs inherent in having a single strategically sourced point of purchase. In fact, in fiscal year (FY) 2015, GSA’s negotiated discount on light-duty vehicles averaged 18.9% below dealer invoice. Given GSA’s FY 2015 procurement of 47,409 vehicles, this discount saved the American taxpayer an estimated $306 million.\n\nAs a full service vehicle leasing option for Federal agencies, GSA drives down costs for Federal customers by providing end-to-end fleet management services at an all-inclusive rate. The leasing program follows GSA’s motor vehicle purchasing program model that has demonstrated year-after-year cost saving results. This model drives down costs by leveraging buying power and consolidating redundant fleet management functions duplicated in many different agencies across government into one high-performing program. GSA’s goal is to empower each Federal agency to focus finite financial and human capital on their missions instead of spending those scarce resources on fleet management functions. GSA’s motor vehicle program provides customers with a comprehensive fleet solution that includes:\n\nVehicle acquisition\n\nMaintenance management\n\nAccident management\n\nA fleet services card for fuel and maintenance with a dedicated waste, fraud, and abuse detection team\n\nA fleet management information system designed to capture detailed vehicle data for purposes of efficiency analysis and cost reduction\n\nOperational support and vehicle management\n\nVehicle tag management\n\nVehicle remarketing\n\nA comprehensive training program for drivers and fleet managers\n\nGSA Fleet supports over 15,000 unique Federal agency customers collectively leasing over 205,000 vehicles. To demonstrate its commitment to providing Federal agencies with the best possible value, GSA decreased its leasing rates the past two fiscal years by 2% and 2.75%, respectively. Additionally, GSA implemented a temporary mid-year rate decrease in FY2015 with an effective annualized total rate decrease of 12%.These decreases were a result of the excellent sales proceeds generated on GSA Fleet vehicles by its dedicated remarketing program, favorable fuel prices and continued improvements in operational efficiencies.\n\nIn addition to the leveraged buying power and government-wide administrative cost savings inherent in a centralized fleet management program, GSA prioritizes helping customers make smart decisions about the composition and size of their leased fleet. Specifically, the program actively works with customers to encourage them to use the most economical vehicle to meet their mission needs, help them select an alternative fuel vehicle wherever feasible, and eliminate unnecessary vehicles from their fleets. While GSA is proud of the progress it has helped customers make in optimizing their fleet size and composition, Federal agencies themselves are empowered to analyze their mission needs and, accordingly, to make the final decision about how many vehicles they need to successfully fulfill the mission tasked to them by Congress. In particular, GSA is not an enforcement agency and cannot require customers to turn in vehicles deemed underutilized. Ultimately, authority for vehicle purchasing and operating decisions remain with each Federal agency.\n\nGSA partners with its customer agencies to help them stretch limited resources and maximize their mission impact. Additionally, GSA assists agencies in meeting Executive Order 13693 in regard to meeting sustainability goals. Some tangible successes in meeting overarching goals include:\n\nEach year, in accordance with GSA’s vehicle replacement standards, GSA Fleet replaces eligible vehicles in the GSA leased fleet with new, more fuel efficient vehicles. Over the past six fiscal years, vehicles added to the fleet had an average of 19 percent higher miles per gallon rating than the corresponding vehicles they replaced.\n\nGSA supported Federal customers in purchasing alternative fuel vehicles to further realize the fuel efficiency of the Federal fleet. Over 82 percent of the vehicles purchased through GSA in FY 2015 were classified as alternative fuel vehicles.\n\nGSA’s Short Term Rental program is available to all Federal customers at no additional cost and allows customers to leverage GSA’s best value rates to rent vehicles and construction equipment for short term requirements. The program eliminates the need for agencies to purchase expensive vehicles and equipment that may be utilized for only seasonal or surge needs.\n\nThe Dispatch and Reservation Module is an intra-agency car-sharing program offered by GSA that allows customers to combine GSA Fleet leased and agency-owned vehicles into motor pools, schedule vehicle reservations, and generate utilization reports all through an electronic system. This information technology car sharing solution allows agencies to track vehicle utilization and thereby identify potential reductions in fleet size to increase efficiency and productivity.\n\nAs a motor vehicle leasing provider, GSA also assumes responsibility for providing solutions that saves the American taxpayer money. GSA’s strategy for meeting these goals involves:\n\nMaintaining vehicles in superior condition, which decreases the need for costly maintenance and repair and vehicle downtime.\n\nReplacing vehicles on schedules designed to maintain a safe, modern, dependable, and fuel efficient fleet while taking advantage of manufacturer warranties to minimize maintenance costs.\n\nNegotiating all maintenance and repairs over $100 to ensure competitive pricing.\n\nActively remarketing used vehicles to the public to ensure the highest possible proceeds are captured upon the sale of each vehicle.\n\nProviding automated management information systems that allow customers to update, query, analyze, and report on all of their fleet vehicle data and to leverage that data to more effectively manage their fleet.\n\nCreating an environment for predictable budget planning and removing the need for large capital outlays for vehicle replacements.\n\nAssisting in compliance efforts for mandates that agencies are required to meet, especially those mandates related to personal safety and procurement of environmentally sustainable products.\n\nReducing the need for administrative overhead across the government by centralizing operational and administrative fleet support functions.\n\nWhere appropriate, consolidating customer agency-owned vehicles and commercially leased vehicle requirements into the GSA Fleet to reduce government-wide costs and redundancies.\n\nGSA currently supports Amtrak for some of its vehicle needs. At the end of FY2015, a total of 1,869 vehicles were leased in the GSA Fleet program to Amtrak. Additionally, GSA’s National Account Advisory Team representative met with the Amtrak Automotive Division staff in October 2015 to discuss transitioning approximately 100 commercially leased vehicles to GSA lease. Those conversations were very productive and today, GSA and Amtrak are finalizing the order of 107 new vehicles that will allow Amtrak to exit more costly commercial leases.\n\nGSA’s mission is to deliver the best value in real estate, acquisition, and technology services to government and the American people. The GSA Office of Fleet Management is committed to this mission by delivering better value and savings, serving our partners, expanding opportunities for small businesses, making a more sustainable government, leading with innovation, and building a stronger GSA.

By adhering to this requirement, federal agencies contribute to the creation of employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe AbilityOne advantage\n\nAlignment with FAR 8.7\n\nFoster inclusivity and socially responsible procurement by aligning agency commitments with FAR 8.7, which emphasizes prioritizing AbilityOne product and services as a mandatory source to support socio-economic goals.\n\nSimplified buying process\n\nMultiple Award Schedule, also known as MAS or GSA Schedule, is the primary contract vehicle used by federal agencies to procure and purchase AbilityOne products and services. MAS offers long-term contracts with pre-negotiated prices, ensuring stable supplier relationships, predictable spending, efficient budget management, and a streamlined procurement process.\n\nWe offer reference tools and resources to make it easy for you to choose AbilityOne:\n\nGSA eLibrary\n\nA centralized online resource with detailed information on the latest contract awards.\n\nGSA Advantage\n\nAn online shopping and ordering portal for products or services offered by AbilityOne-authorized nonprofit agencies.\n\nGSA Global Supply\n\nA requisition-based ordering program for AbilityOne office supplies, tools, computer products, safety gear, and cleaning products.\n\nConvenient payment option\n\nAuthorized users can pay for AbilityOne products and services with the GSA SmartPay® Purchase Card (GPC).\n\nCommercial Platforms for flexibility\n\nConsider using Commercial Platforms to fulfill mandatory purchasing requirements that support the AbilityOne Program. The program provides access to eight online platforms: Amazon Business, e-Procurement Services, Fisher Scientific, G-Commerce, Grainger, NOBLE, Pacific Ink, and Staples. For more information about purchasing requirements and guidelines, please visit the Commercial Platforms page.\n\n \n\nCompliance assurance\n\nThe Procurement List is the official roster of nonprofit agencies or NPAs currently participating in the AbilityOne Program. The list is maintained by the U.S. AbilityOne Commission, guaranteeing that the products and services provided by the NPAs meet rigorous quality standards and comply with government regulations. Federal agencies are mandated to source specific products and services from the Procurement List.\n\nThis compliance helps ensure that agencies make meaningful and impactful purchasing decisions that align with their socio-economic goals and legal obligations.

Hochberg\n\n            September 29, 2010\n                   - Washington DC\n\nChairman Meeks, Chairman Moore, Ranking Members Miller and Biggert, and Members of the Subcommittees: Thank you for inviting me to testify before this joint hearing on what the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im or the Bank) is doing to create and sustain jobs here in the United States during this very difficult economic period. Since its establishment in 1934, Ex-Im has had but one central objective: to create and sustain American jobs through exports. Ex-Im was founded with this goal during the depths of the Great Depression and has remained true to this mission during the recent economic crisis. Most importantly, this support of American workers comes at no cost to the taxpayer. Ex-Im is self-sustaining, meaning that it funds its program and administrative budgets from fees paid by buyers and borrowers, not from funds provided by U.S. taxpayers. Since 1992, Ex-Im has returned more than $4.5 billion to the American taxpayers. MEETING THE CURRENT FINANCIAL CHALLENGE To meet the unprecedented challenges facing our economy and our U.S. exporters, the Bank has increased lending under its loan, guarantee and insurance programs. In FY 2009, Ex-Im's financing was more than $21 billion, a record for the institution and about a fifty percent increase over FY 2008. Of this $21 billion, $4.4 billion, or 21%, of such authorizations supported small business. And Ex-Im has already surpassed its total authorizations for FY 2009. In fact, for FY 2010, which closes tomorrow, the Bank's total authorizations are expected to be about $25 billion, which translates into about 230,000 jobs created or sustained. In this current fiscal year, approximately 85% of the Bank's transactions are with American small businesses, and Ex-Im has helped almost 2,000 small businesses expand their export sales in 2010. Ex-Im anticipates that more than 20% of its total authorizations for FY 2010 supported small business. While I am pleased to report these results, I personally get much greater satisfaction in looking beyond the dollar signs and percentages to the jobs Ex-Im is supporting. During my first few months on the job, I was fortunate enough to meet Luis Arguello, the founder and owner of Demetech, a Miami small business that exports surgical sutures to more than 80 countries. This year, Demetech sales are up almost 100%, and he attributes about 30% of such increase to the support provided by Ex-Im. More importantly, about 40 of Demetech's 100 employees are working today to fill orders supported by Ex-Im. My goal as Chairman is to help more companies follow Luis' example. As the official export credit agency of the United States, Ex-Im plays a critical role in President Obama's National Export Initiative that seeks to double exports to $3.14 trillion by 2015. Working with Congress and other executive agencies, Ex-Im Bank is helping to lead this effort. Exports of U.S. goods and services increased 17.9 percent during the first seven months of FY 2010, according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Commerce Department. The United States remains on track to meet President Obama's goal of doubling exports and supporting millions of American jobs over the next five years. Throughout the economic crisis, Ex-Im has played the crucial role that the American people expect. By expanding its programs and increasing its marketing efforts, the Bank is able to assist more U.S. exporters facing the challenges of this current global environment as well as reach more potential U.S. small business exporters. For instance, in reviewing long-term trends for Ex-Im financing, it becomes apparent that such financings often are counter-cyclical -- when commercial financing contracts, the Bank's authorizations expand. The Bank's authorizations are up about 50% across the board, and Ex-Im has seen its direct lending go from an average of about $100 million annually from prior to the crisis to approximately $4.4 billion this year. NATIONAL EXPORT INITIATIVE To achieve President Obama's goal of doubling exports, Ex-Im needs to do more than just respond when credit markets constrict. As many Members of this Committee already know, 95% of the world's consumers live outside of America's borders. By tapping into these growing markets, exporters will create higher-paying sustainable U.S. jobs, as Americans working for a firm that exports generally earn more than 15% more than similar workers at firms that do not export. Ex-Im financing is often the crucial factor to allow American companies to step into the export arena. As outlined in the recent Report to the President on the National Export Initiative: The Export Promotion Cabinet's Plan for Doubling U.S. Exports in Five Years, Ex-Im, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Small Business Administration, plan to implement the following six steps to satisfy the expected increased demand for export credit assistance. First, Ex-Im plans new products and an expansion of its existing credit platforms. Two weeks ago, Ex-Im launched a new supply-chain finance guarantee program through which suppliers of components used in products destined for export can sell their accounts receivable. This program will inject liquidity into the marketplace and supply “hidden exporters” with ready access to capital to ramp up production so that American small businesses are able to tap into the rich export market. Additionally, Ex-Im Bank will soon launch a reinsurance program to help U.S. exporters obtain credit insurance in a market that has curtailed capacity, enabling these companies to manage commercial and political risk in developing markets often shunned by commercial insurers. Second, this past May, Ex-Im expanded access for small business users of Ex-Im Bank's short-term insurance and working capital guarantee programs. Among other effects, this change expanded the scope of eligibility of the exported items to include all U.S. value added and allowed Ex-Im support of both direct and indirect costs. Luis Arguello of Demetech explains this change as well as anyone. He told me “a component, be it a screw, bolt or a piece of fabric, often represents a small portion of the inputs in selling a product overseas. Demetech's costs in producing a product for export includes more than just a piece of sterile thread, it includes quality control, design, labeling, book-keeping and related support. All of those associated costs mean jobs for Miami-area workers.” Third, while Ex-Im Bank is open for business in approximately 175 countries (the latest being its July opening in Iraq for short and medium-term transactions), Ex-Im Bank has decided to focus its limited outreach resources on nine countries with some of the highest potential for infrastructure growth. Over the next five years, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Turkey, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Nigeria, and South Africa are expected to spend more than $3 trillion on infrastructure improvements. The infrastructure needs of these growing economies, ranging from medical to transportation to energy, align with the technological and productive capacities of the United States. As always, Ex-Im will continue to provide financing all over the globe, but these nine nations offer a special opportunity for American firms and Ex-Im. Fourth, quite frankly, Ex-Im Bank is doing a better job of letting American business know about the availability of export financing assistance, especially small and medium-sized companies. Jointly with the Department of Commerce, and Small Business Administration, Ex-Im has led sixteen “Exports Live” seminars, which have been attended by about 3500 people, designed to provide small businesses with the tools they need to begin exporting. Most recently, I traveled to Richmond with Commerce Secretary Gary Locke for an export symposium hosted by Senator Mark Warner, and I would like to offer to come to each of your districts in the near future to discuss the role Ex-Im can play in increasing exports from your state or district. Fifth, given its limited size, Ex-Im is expanding the number and scope of public-private partnerships. As the main conduit for government export credit, Ex-Im has a staff of fewer than 400. On the other hand, there are an estimated 289,000 exporters in the United States, 97% of which are small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, Ex-Im is seeking to leverage new and existing relationships with financial intermediaries, city-state economic development agencies and other entities to increase its outreach and build its presence outside of Washington, DC. Along with SBA, Ex-Im Bank is looking for lenders to participate in our guarantee programs by originating and, in some cases, underwriting transactions. Personally, I have met with lenders in cities from Billings to Boston to enlist their support and listen to their concerns on how Ex-Im can do a better job of servicing U.S. exporters. Our City/State Marketing program is an excellent example of coordination between the federal and local level in support of the National Export Initiative. The Bank currently has 61 City/State partners and is continuing to work to increase the number of partnerships. Sixth, Ex-Im will move at the speed of business. No where is this as critical as when dealing with the Bank's small business clients, who may be coming to Ex-Im for the first time. Ex-Im, therefore, is working to streamline the application and review process particularly for those products used by small business, and senior management and I meet every Monday morning at 10:00 to monitor progress. To expedite the transactional turn-around, the Bank is looking to reduce impediments to expanded business with existing banks, brokers and partners through simplification of conditions, faster processing, automated underwriting, and systemized follow-up. EX-IM INITIATIVES In addition to the Bank's efforts for small business, there are three other priorities I have for the Bank. First, Ex-Im is expanding its promotion of environmental exports. Second, the Bank is paying special attention to assisting exporters of services. Third, Ex-Im is helping more U.S. companies access the growing economies of Sub-Saharan Africa. Promoting renewable energy and other green exports is a high priority of the Bank. During the last five years, Ex-Im's support of environmentally-beneficial exports has increased dramatically from $2.64 million in FY 2007 to an estimated $330 million for FY 2010. Current estimates indicate that the total value of renewable energy exports from the United States is approximately $2 billion annually (excluding hydroelectric and geothermal power). Ex-Im Bank remains committed to supporting more of these sales and is working to grow its support for renewable energy transactions in FY 2011. In 2008, Ex-Im created the Office of Renewable Energy and Environmental Exports and doubled the staff of such office in FY 2010. This past April, on Earth Day, Ex-Im announced its new Solar Express product that will provide streamlined financing for U.S. exports to small solar-energy projects that could be approved in as few as 60 days. Export sales using Solar Express will enable the Bank to consider project financing for small solar-power producers seeking loans of $3 million to $10 million. Ex-Im also is a major driver of the growth in U.S. wind energy exports. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce the United States exported a total of $318.7 million of wind energy equipment in FY 2009. In FY 2010, Ex-Im Bank authorized $220.6 million in financing for the export of U.S. made wind turbines and related equipment. Ex-Im Bank financed large wind turbine exporters Clipper Windpower and Gamesa, as well as small wind turbine makers Southwest Windpower and Bergey Windpower. While Ex-Im understands and appreciates the legislative goal that 10% of its authorizations should support environmentally-beneficial exports, this may be a challenging target to achieve. Given that Ex-Im's expected FY 2010 authorizations of about $25 billion and that the total value of renewable energy exports from the United States is about $2 billion, Ex-Im could support virtually all renewable exports and still not reach the 10% goal. That said, the Bank remains committed to expanding its support of environmental exports environmental exports, and you have my personal commitment that this will remain a priority of the Bank. Ex-Im was the first, and thus far only, ECA to institute a carbon policy. One notable example of how this policy is working to benefit the environment and U.S. exporters is the Sasan power project. The Bank's Board of Directors originally voted to decline support for the sale of drag-lines and other mining equipment for the construction and operation of a coal-fired power plant located in northeast India to be operated by Reliance Power Ltd. due to environmental concerns. However, after the Board's initial decision, Reliance executed a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to supply 250 MW of renewable energy sourced from the United States and agreed to operate the plant so its carbon intensity not exceed 850 grams CO2/kWh. This is the first time a financing has been made conditional on carbon emissions performance. A second coal-fired power project to be developed by South Africa's government-owned power utility Eskom will be subjected to the enhanced environmental due diligence called for by Ex-Im's carbon policy in the coming months. Ex-Im is the leader among both OECD and non-OECD countries on climate-change issues, and is the only ECA that regularly reports the carbon emissions of projects it supports. Ex-Im's new carbon policy resulted in significant changes in the Indian project. Balancing the interests of some U.S. exporters with Ex-Im's environmental obligations remains a challenge, but Ex-Im Bank is committed to being a leader in the ECA community on this issue, and the Bank is advocating that other ECAs adopt similar policies to reduce greenhouse gases. In this way, Ex-Im can help maintain a level playing field for U.S. exporters and their workers. I also am working to increase the Bank's efforts to the service sector. Ex-Im Bank supports the export of services as well as capital goods, which is a point I often highlight at our Export Live events. For FY's 2007 through 2009, Ex-Im support for services increased steadily - $1.875 billion in FY 2007, $2.213 billion in FY 2008, and $3.791 billion in FY 2009. This total of $7.879 billion comprised about 16.4% of Ex-Im's total financing of $48 billion for that period. There is room for improvement, and this amount should continue to increase, such as legal and banking services, which comprise only 2.3% of the Bank's financings for services. Services account for a trade surplus and a real competitive advantage for U.S. companies. Finally, Ex-Im is helping more U.S. companies take advantage of emerging opportunities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Congress has directed the Bank to increase financing of U.S. exports to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in a manner consistent with the Bank's requirement of reasonable assurance of repayment. To this end, Ex-Im has an SSA Advisory Committee that provides insights and advice on the region to assist the Bank in fulfilling its mandate and has created a dedicated Africa business-development group. In addition, the Bank created a $100 million Short-Term Africa Initiative, which makes insurance available for exports to 20 SSA countries that would otherwise not be eligible for Ex-Im support and two bank facilities, one in Nigeria and the other in Angola, help open markets in such countries. As a result of our outreach and credit policy, the Bank has supported over $5 billion in transactions to SSA since 1999. Last year alone, the Bank authorized over $400 million in exports to SSA countries. While Ex-Im's books have not closed for FY 2010, the Bank expects to double this number to over $800 million this year. In terms of U.S. exports, Nigeria and South Africa are the two largest markets in SSA for U.S. exports. As previously mentioned, the Bank has designated these two countries as part of our strategic initiative, and I expect to visit them in November.\n\nBUDGET REQUEST\n\nTo reach President Obama's ambitious goals for jobs and exports, Ex-Im needs Congress to appropriate the full amount of the President's request for the Bank's FY 2011 administrative budget. And as I said previously, Ex-Im Bank is self-financing, so this increase comes at no cost to U.S. taxpayers. We are all aware that full recovery from the recession will not take place until the employment figures improve, and one of the best ways to do this is to assist small businesses. The request of $105.6 million includes a request for $13.5 million fund to expand small business outreach, new regional offices, and increased staff to improve the turn-around time on small business applications. Congress has instructed the Bank that at least 20% of its authorizations should directly benefit U.S. small businesses, and Ex-Im expects to be at or exceed this level in FY 2010. Like you, I consider this goal to be a floor, not a ceiling. The Bank's small business authorizations are increasing, but not as fast as its financing for larger transactions.\n\n \n\nSPECIAL CHALLENGE Notwithstanding the phenomenal performance of the Bank over the last two years and in addition to its resource constraints, Ex-Im faces the growing challenge of meeting the competition of countries who are not members of the OECD and, therefore, do not have to abide by the Arrangement. China is the country most often cited. The Chinese are making inroads in markets all over the world, with special attention to Africa, Asia and Latin America. China raises challenges both through the use of more generous export credits terms and trade-distorting tied aid. I wish I could tell you that I have the answer to this problem, but the fact is, while Ex-Im can match Chinese export credits that are better than allowed under the OECD rules, Ex-Im does not have the resources to match the trade-distorting concessional financing offered by the Chinese in many markets. When it was first established, the tied aid “war-chest” (as it was known) was created to induce foreign governments to negotiate a set of rules to discipline trade-related aid and channel aid resources away from commercial projects in rich countries. As the OECD tied aid rules have now been in place for almost two decades, aid policies have evolved and the list of donor countries has grown tremendously - to include many non-OECD countries, most notably, China - that choose to apply substantial budgetary resources to tied aid. While the Chinese development aid, like development aid from any country, is welcome, tied aid use for commercially viable projects is trade distorting. Against this backdrop, the funds that Ex-Im Bank has available for tied aid “matching” at present are limited, an amount hovering around $170 million, considering the competitive landscape. Nevertheless, Ex-Im Bank will continue to seek opportunities to employ these funds, in coordination with Treasury, to level the playing field for U.S. exporters competing with trade distorting foreign tied aid offers from other countries. Additionally, Ex-Im Bank remains committed to working with our OECD partners to encourage non-member ECAs to play by the same rules. That said, the opacity and capacity of non-member ECAs remains a challenge for Ex-Im Bank and U.S. exporters, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n \n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ex-Im has identified nine target markets, and I have travelled to seven of them and will be heading to Nigeria and South Africa later this year. Leaders in all these countries say the same thing: They want to buy U.S. goods not because they are cheap, but because our innovation, quality and service after sale are unmatched by our global competitors. U.S. exporters deliver long-term value, and Ex-Im Bank is committed to helping their efforts. I want to close by assuring you that we at Ex-Im Bank are determined to do our part in helping to grow employment here in the United States. This is our mission and we are going to work tirelessly to fulfill it. I am always open to your suggestions and want to hear from you and, as I said earlier, hold programs around the country to inform your constituents of the resources Ex-Im is able to provide to them. Thank you for this opportunity to testify. I will be happy to answer your questions.\n\nAre you ready to begin your export journey?

It is an honor to be here again with you exactly seven weeks after I was sworn in as President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM).\n\nThis is my third time to come before this Committee. In 2017 and 2018, I testified before you as an EXIM nominee. I thank you for your three favorable bipartisan votes in support of my nomination to be the first woman and first West Virginian to lead EXIM.\n\nI also thank you for your leadership when I came before the full United States Senate on May 8, where I was confirmed by the United States Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority vote. I was especially struck by the gracious comments that several of you and other Senators made on the Senate floor. It has been a long two-and-a-half-year journey towards Senate confirmation and I am now honored to be leading EXIM.\n\nMy two fellow Board Members, Spencer Bachus and Judith Pryor, also thank the Chairman, the Ranking Member, and the other Members of this Committee for your support. We look forward to welcoming the President's final two Board nominees pending Senate action: First Vice President and Vice Chairman designee Paul Shmotolokha and Board Member designee Claudia Slacik.\n\nThe Chairman has specifically asked that I update the Committee on matters that have been awaiting the consideration of the Board, my priorities for EXIM going forward, the reforms that we have previously discussed, as well as my views relating to the Committee's consideration of EXIM's reauthorization. I am pleased to do just this.\n\nLet me first set the stage by sharing with you the priorities that I shared with the nearly 400 talented and dedicated EXIM employees on my first day of work exactly 49 days ago: I am committed to fully reopening, reforming, and reauthorizing EXIM, thereby providing positive results for America's workers and businesses, while protecting America's taxpayers.\n\nRESTORING A FULLY FUNCTIONING EXIM\n\nEXIM is the official export credit agency (ECA) of the United States with the mission, as mandated by Congress, of promoting and supporting American jobs and growing the U.S. economy. EXIM provides competitive export credit to support U.S. exports and U.S. workers. EXIM achieves this primarily by providing financing for the purchase of U.S. exports, insuring U.S. exporters from the risk of non-payment by foreign buyers, and extending working capital loan guarantees that enable U.S. businesses to fill export orders. All transactions are required to meet the statutory threshold of a reasonable assurance of repayment.\n\nAs mandated by Congress, EXIM offers financing at rates and on terms that are competitive with government-backed export financing available from other countries. The goal of EXIM financing is to ensure U.S. exporters and workers can compete on the quality and price of their goods and services – and not lose business to foreign competitors because of their government-backed financing.\n\nWhen it is fully functioning with a board quorum, EXIM is self-sustaining because of the fees and interest it charges to foreign buyers for the use of its programs. Since 1992, when the Federal Credit Reform Act became effective, EXIM has generated $9.6 billion in revenues above what the Bank has received after providing for all expenses, loan-loss reserves, and administrative costs.\n\nIn the last ten years, EXIM has supported more than one and a half million private-sector American jobs. As you might imagine, EXIM has a backlog of applications that need Board consideration. Today, EXIM has approximately $40 billion worth of transactions at various stages in its pipeline for Board-level review that would support an estimated 230,000 U.S. jobs. EXIM staff is working diligently through the reviews of these applications with respect to EXIM policies and all applicable statutory requirements.\n\nBut as we fully reopen, EXIM is reemerging to a dramatically more competitive environment in officially supported export credit as compared to when it was last fully functional. There are now 113 foreign ECAs in other countries – up from 96 when I testified before you in 2017, and I know first-hand that more nations are in the process of establishing their own ECAs.\n\nOver the past four years, the U.S. exporting community has reported that while EXIM's foreign buyer financing programs remained essentially dormant, foreign ECAs have become more flexible, agile, and responsive as they seek to sell their own country's goods to support their workers, manufacturers, and economies. The Administration – including the President's National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow – has underscored that economic security is national security, and that EXIM plays an important role in promoting U.S. exports.\n\nOne of my top priorities is ensuring that we are clearly communicating to U.S. exporters and foreign buyers that EXIM is fully operational and ready to begin moving board-level transactions forward. After nearly four years awaiting EXIM to be restored to full functionality, I am pleased to say that EXIM staff is working very hard with the applicants to finalize applications and conduct the necessary due diligence to bring these transactions before the EXIM Board.\n\nAmong the core requirements in EXIM's analysis of transactions is a review of the &quot;Five C's&quot; of credit: Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, and Conditions. EXIM must evaluate the trustworthiness and reliability of the parties to a transaction; the cash-flow, debt burden, and financial stability of those parties; the source of the down-payment; the quality of the collateral; and the limitations on the use of the requested financing. This analysis is critical to how EXIM conducts its determination that a transaction adheres to the statutory requirement of a reasonable assurance of repayment. Based on those reviews, EXIM considers what additional risk mitigants may be necessary to enhance the quality of the credit and to better protect the U.S. Government from the risk of default.\n\nEXIM is mandated by its Charter to supplement and not compete with private capital in its transactions. As part of its review, EXIM looks at why the parties to a transaction are seeking EXIM financing, what limitations exist in the availability or terms of private capital, and the availability and terms of competing financing offered by a foreign export credit agency. All transactions are processed in accordance with EXIM policies, such as those on U.S. content, U.S. flag shipping requirements, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nEXIM's Environmental and Social Due Diligence Procedures and Guidelines require heightened reviews for certain transactions with the potential for adverse effects. EXIM reviews environmental and social impact assessments, analyses of alternatives, and proposed mitigation plans to determine their sufficiency and identify what additional steps may be necessary to address potential shortcomings. These assessments are readily available on EXIM's website for public review. Transactions are further reviewed for compliance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Common Approaches for Officially Supported Export Credits and Environmental and Social Due Diligence, and the Equator Principles, as well as guidelines based on the International Finance Corporation's Performance Standards and the Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines of the World Bank Group.\n\nCertain transactions further require EXIM to undertake more in-depth economic impact assessments, which involve both an interagency review process and a public comment period. All applications for financing that equal or exceed $100 million also require congressional notifications and Federal Register postings before EXIM is able to make a final commitment.\n\nLike any pipeline or deal funnel, not all transactions may come to fruition for reasons outside of EXIM's control. These are highly complex transactions and legal and commercial considerations are not always finalized at the time EXIM receives an application. New issues may arise that require further negotiation before a transaction is ready for Board consideration. In fact, U.S. exporters lost approximately $13.3 billion of sales during the four years in which EXIM lacked a quorum.\n\nAt this point, EXIM staff estimate that transactions worth more than $20 billion will be ready for consideration by the Board in the first year of full functionality. We expect the Board will vote on some of these applications this summer.\n\nThe plan is to work through the applications at a reasonable and prudent pace. Though we want to make our way through the pipeline, we take our obligation to protect the interests of U.S. taxpayers very seriously. EXIM has averaged a default rate of less than half of a percent over the past decade because of the care and thoughtfulness that goes into the review and structuring of these transactions. EXIM also takes seriously its responsibility to ensure we're only supporting transactions that cannot obtain a volume or tenor of financing in the market sufficient to realize economic viability. While we are anxious to move transactions forward, we cannot rush through the necessary reviews. Moving through the applications in a responsible way will be a huge victory in our collective efforts to support American exporters, businesses, and workers. EXIM also expects an influx of new applications to support foreign purchases of U.S. goods and services. As I underscored at my two confirmation hearings, EXIM can and must support businesses of all sizes that the private sector will not adequately finance, especially small- and medium-sized businesses, and I will comment more on small business later in my testimony. No matter the size or type of transaction, EXIM must be guided by the requirements of its Charter and ensure it is carrying out its Congressionally-mandated mission in a thoughtful and responsible way.\n\nINSTITUTING REFORMS AND OTHER PRIORITIES AT EXIM\n\nI am committed to working with this Committee and the Congress to transform EXIM, which is particularly important as we head into reauthorization.\n\nDuring my July 19, 2018, confirmation hearing before this Committee, we discussed the future direction of EXIM. I was asked six specific questions:\n\nWill you work with me and other Members of this Committee and the Senate to increase transparency at the Bank to the greatest extent that is practicable without divulging confidential business information?\n\nWill you work with me and the Committee to strengthen taxpayer protections against losses from deals that go badly?\n\nWill you work with me and Members of the Committee to improve protection for domestic companies from economic harm that might arise from EXIM Bank financings with foreign competitors?\n\nWill you work with us to ensure that EXIM Bank is not crowding out private financing options that would otherwise be available but for EXIM Bank's involvement?\n\nWill you work with me and the Committee to crack down on bad actors, whether they are employees of the Bank or its customers who should not be dealing with the Bank?\n\nWill you work with all of us and the Administration to meet the statutory requirement that we work to reduce the reliance on ECAs globally?\n\nI answered each of these questions in the affirmative and am following through on these commitments as we work to transform EXIM.\n\nFor example, immediately after being sworn in, I traveled to China to participate in the annual Group of 12 Member Nations (G12) Heads of Export Credit Agencies Meeting. I had the pleasure of meeting and engaging with my counterpart heads of foreign ECAs. I heard from the leaders of these organizations on what foreign ECAs having been doing while EXIM was not fully operational, including the strategic role that they are playing to further their countries' own national interests. I sought to revitalize U.S. leadership in negotiations, as Congress has specified in the EXIM Charter, to reduce subsidized export financing programs, enhance transparency, and level the playing field. While the Treasury Department leads these negotiations, under my leadership, EXIM will coordinate closely with Congress and Treasury through full and frank technical insights. As an outcome of the meeting, we secured the support of the G12 for the United States to host the 2020 G12 Meeting here in Washington, D.C. I would like to thank my ECA counterparts again for their commitment to cooperation and collaboration.\n\nNot long after I returned from China, President Trump designated me to lead the United States Presidential Delegation to South Africa to attend the inauguration of South Africa's President, Cyril Ramaphosa. While there, I was able to help advance another critical Congressional mandate with many sub-Saharan government and business leaders. I made it clear that EXIM is fully functional and ready to facilitate greater support for trade with sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nEXIM held its first board meeting just three weeks after the board quorum was confirmed by the U.S. Senate. This was the first time that the EXIM Board has met since July 2015. EXIM ex officio Board Member U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., and Ambassador Jeffrey D. Gerrish, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative for Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Industrial Competitiveness, also participated.\n\nAt this meeting, the Board satisfied the remaining legislative reforms outstanding from the Export-Import Bank Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-94) that could not be completed without a Board quorum. We confirmed the appointments of a Chief Risk Officer and a Chief Ethics Officer. These roles are critical to carrying out the reforms mandated under the 2015 reauthorization, by elevating EXIM's focus on managing risk and adhering to the highest ethical standards.\n\nThe Board enhanced EXIM's ability to efficiently and responsibly process transactions under $25 million. Specifically, in accordance with the intent of Congress as set forth in 2015, the Board delegated authority for short- and medium-term transactions up to $25 million to senior EXIM officers.\n\nAs we look at our EXIM programs and potential reforms, it is also important to receive input from diverse experts outside of government. As such, we have just launched the process to reestablish the Congressionally-mandated Advisory Committee and the Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee. We are currently accepting nominations for members to be considered for both committees. Applications will be accepted until July 24, 2019, and more details can be found on the EXIM website or through the Federal Register. These committees are charged with providing feedback to EXIM and to Congress on how to ensure the design and operations of EXIM programs are meeting the needs of United States exporters for competitive financing.\n\nEXIM also must supplement and enhance – not compete with – private sector financing. As I pledged to you in my 2018 testimony, I have now begun internal discussions to review and strengthen the adequacy of EXIM's &quot;additionality&quot; criteria to ensure that EXIM is playing a complementary and necessary role in mobilizing private sector financing to assist U.S. companies operating in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.\n\nI also am committed to improving EXIM's transparency to the greatest extent that is practicable without divulging confidential business information. EXIM has made important progress in recent years in the area of transparency, but we always can do more. Greater transparency will increase the confidence of EXIM's stakeholders that we are pursuing our mission appropriately while protecting taxpayers. As just one part of this commitment, I will seek to improve EXIM's documentation of its additionality determinations and publish these determinations so that the bases for these decisions are available to all of our stakeholders.\n\nSupporting small business is vital to EXIM's mission and I am committed to doing even more. Twenty-five years ago, EXIM established its Small Business Division focused entirely on ensuring that small businesses have access to the trade finance tools they need to succeed in markets around the world. Since that time, the global market for U.S. exporters has changed dramatically. Throughout the global financial crisis and its aftermath, EXIM stood by small businesses, helping to fill the gap in private sector financing.\n\nWhile the loss of a Board quorum affected businesses of all sizes, EXIM's dedicated staff continued to work with small businesses, their lenders, and brokers, on how EXIM's working capital loan guarantee and export credit insurance programs could help these companies grow their sales globally. Between Fiscal Years 2016 and 2018, EXIM approved more than 7,000 transactions in direct support of small businesses.\n\nThe first event I hosted at EXIM was a small business roundtable with business leaders from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia who also are EXIM small business customers. Their concerns are top-of-mind for me and the other members of EXIM's new Board. No transaction is too small. We know how important every sale is for businesses that operate on thin margins and how a single sale can affect an owner's ability to make payroll or bring a new employee on board.\n\nStill, I want to make it clear that we can and must revitalize EXIM's commitment to small businesses. For that to happen, we must strengthen EXIM's ability to meet U.S. small businesses that cannot access adequate commercial financing where they are with the tools they need.\n\nAmong our first priorities will be to dramatically strengthen our relationship with private sector lenders and brokers – as well as with federal, state, and local government agencies that regularly communicate with U.S. businesses large and small – through a forward-leaning, proactive strategy focused on providing improved resources that will help them more effectively communicate to small businesses about how EXIM financing solutions can make a difference in boosting their sales while protecting their bottom line.\n\nWe will develop new opportunities to better track how EXIM works with individual small businesses, making sure that they are taking full advantage of their EXIM policies to maximize sales, and helping to answer any questions they have about how EXIM – or other federal resources – can help them boost their competitiveness.\n\nWhen small businesses look beyond our shores to reach new global markets that commercial lenders tend to avoid, EXIM can help reduce the risk of selling products in emerging and frontier markets. Yet, too many people today simply do not know what EXIM is or how our products can work for them. That is why I am committed to dedicating new resources to help EXIM reach more small businesses across various channels, whether it is through the internet, social media, trade associations, industry publications, chambers of commerce, or trade shows.\n\nWe are currently developing outreach strategies that will improve EXIM's outreach to small businesses in underserved communities, rural and urban areas, tribal communities, and the territories.\n\nAnother key issue that I am focusing on is identifying new ways EXIM can support the agricultural sector. EXIM already provides enhanced coverage and payment terms for exports of bulk agricultural commodities under its export credit insurance policy. For the many farmers who may not directly export themselves, but instead sell their goods to a buyer who then serves as the exporter, EXIM's working capital program supports these indirect exporters to increase their access to credit.\n\nI am committed to building on EXIM's outreach efforts to amplify our message to rural communities so that more farmers and ranchers can learn about how EXIM can work for them. We are also looking at better aligning our underwriting teams to enhance our industry expertise. This will help facilitate improved processing times that will benefit agricultural exporters.\n\nAs we continue our efforts to strengthen our programs for this important sector, I will work with my colleagues in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and Under Secretary for Trade Ted McKinney, to ensure that we are complementing, not duplicating, their efforts and delivering effective solutions for our farmers and ranchers.\n\nIn addition, I take seriously the statutory and overarching mandate of EXIM's Inspector General to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of EXIM's programs and operations while preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse. The Inspector General accomplishes its mission through the conduct of audits, investigations, inspections, and evaluations. I believe a strong Inspector General is key to protecting the American taxpayers.\n\nWhile EXIM's mission has always been helping to grow the U.S. economy and American jobs through exports, it is increasingly clear that EXIM has a role to play in supporting U.S. strategic interests and critical industries. My recent conversation with Iraq's Ambassador to the United States underscored yet again the importance of EXIM in advancing broader policy objectives. The Ambassador told me that increasing the involvement of the U.S. private sector in rebuilding Iraq through EXIM support would not only accelerate technological advancement, but also would improve security in Iraq and in the region.\n\nThis is just a glimpse of all that has been going on at EXIM in just the past seven weeks. These developments would not be possible without our exceptional EXIM staff. In addition to seeing EXIM brought to full capacity, one of my immediate priorities is to improve the employee experience. To assist with developing a plan of action, I have brought on board an expert with many years of experience in employee engagement, change management, and organizational\n\ndevelopment to identify opportunities and address employee concerns. We are collaborating with several employee-driven task forces that convened over the last several years to analyze EXIM's annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) results. The FEVS survey that looks back over the past year was launched as I arrived and will serve as a benchmark for us to work from as we go forward to make EXIM one of the best places to work in the Federal government.\n\nREAUTHORIZING EXIM\n\nAs I previously testified before this Committee, I believe that free-market principles are the best way to foster economic opportunity for all Americans. Throughout my twenty-three year career, I have embraced these principles to make a positive difference for our nation's businesses and workers while also protecting the American taxpayer. Still, there is room for improvement to keep America on this road to prosperity, and EXIM is no exception. The global competitive landscape facing our nation's economy and U.S. exporters has changed dramatically since EXIM was first established, and our stakeholders have reported to us that competition has intensified during EXIM's four years of limited operations, but the critically important EXIM mission has not. EXIM still supports American jobs through exports.\n\nThe Administration looks forward to working with this Committee and the Congress to advance reauthorization legislation that ensures that EXIM is fully able to continue its vital mission, as a reliable partner to exporters' efforts to secure foreign customers. A robust and reformed EXIM can help the world to &quot;Buy USA,&quot; preserve domestic manufacturing supply chains, combat what our stakeholders have reported as increasingly aggressive efforts by foreign governments to undercut the competitiveness of U.S. exporters, further America's national and economic security objectives by facilitating U.S. exports to markets around the world, and protect the U.S. taxpayer.\n\nINTENSIFYING GLOBAL COMPETITION\n\nFor decades, the United States has worked through the OECD to establish a level playing field, a framework – the OECD Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits (&quot;the Arrangement&quot;) – for the provision of official export credit, including risk-based pricing. The focus of the Arrangement has been to restrict foreign export credit subsidies and encourage global export competition based on the quality and price of goods and services exported, rather than predatory financing terms. The Arrangement is a living document. Over the years EXIM has contributed its technical expertise and experience to support the U.S. in establishing market- oriented rules based on best – not trade distorting – export credit practices. The Arrangement is also a &quot;gentleman's agreement,&quot; and is only as good as the commitment of the Participants to its guidelines.\n\nAs required under its Charter, EXIM submits an annual Competitiveness Report to Congress by June 30 of each year. The report reviews the actions of EXIM in providing financing on terms and conditions &quot;which are fully competitive&quot; with those offered by other governments, and the progress of efforts to minimize competition in government-supported export financing. It also includes a survey of all other major export-financing facilities available from other governments and government-related agencies through which foreign exporters compete with the United States. For many years, this was largely done by looking at how EXIM's programs compared with that of other Participants to the Arrangement and the extent to which the Arrangement was succeeding in achieving its goals of minimizing market distortions and fostering transparency.\n\nEXIM's soon-to-be released annual Competitiveness Report examines how deeply, widely, and fundamentally officially supported export financing has changed over the last 10 to 15 years. The most significant development has been the loss of a level playing field. Emerging markets now import fewer goods and services and instead have their own robust ECAs to promote their exports onto global markets. The ECAs of China, India, and other countries that do not participate in the OECD Arrangement operate without regard to the basic standards of transparency and fairness established among Arrangement Participants.\n\nToday, China is the largest provider of official export credit, which it uses to increase the scale, technology, and market position of its manufacturers as global leaders. In 2018 alone, EXIM estimates China provided more than $39 billion in medium- and long-term export credit financing—more than the next top three ECAs combined. While this number is very large, it is dwarfed by the $481.4 billion of short-term export credit China provided in 2018.1 This helps China penetrate the complex supply chains of global manufacturing.\n\nSince 2012, the United States has been trying to work with China and other governments through the International Working Group on Export Credits to establish a new international framework for a level playing field among all major providers of medium- and long-term official export finance.\n\nWhile those discussions continue, OECD members are taking practical actions to address the very real threat that China poses to their overall industrial competitiveness. OECD ECAs have reported introducing and expanding programs and capabilities outside of the scope of the Arrangement that are focused on achieving strategic goals and forging business partnerships to establish a long-term footprint in key markets.\n\nA growing number of ECAs and their governments have chosen a proactive approach that puts export finance at the center of trade policy. No longer reactive or the lender of last resort, foreign ECAs have reported that they are increasingly seeking out transactions, putting financing packages in place, and identifying ways to maximize the number of domestic suppliers or exporters involved in the global supply chain of strategic sectors, often engaging in &quot;match- making&quot; efforts between their suppliers and foreign buyers. They report that they are using official export credit to support robust domestic supply chains, enhance efficient shipping and logistics, open the door to follow-on exports, deepen economic ties, and develop engineering and technological expertise in key sectors.\n\nConsequently, financing provided under the terms of the Arrangement represented just 36 percent of total government-backed export and trade-related financing in 2018, including development financing.2\n\nChina has been very explicit in its efforts to extend its economic influence through its export credit and investment support for the Belt and Road Initiative. More than 60 countries are discussing or developing projects with China now. Estimates show China could spend as much as $1.3 trillion by 2027 on investments throughout the Belt and Road Initiative region.3\n\nAt the same time, China has outlined its &quot;Made in China 2025&quot; strategy—a strategy designed to transform China into a manufacturing superpower and in which China's ECAs play an important role 4—to develop domestic industries in sectors of key strategic importance. By developing critical infrastructure expertise, China can establish footholds in strategic geographic regions, control power generation, the electrical grid, and telecommunications networks, and reshape its economic footprint to align with its global ambitions.\n\nChina is known to provide export and trade-related financing through at least three different entities to turn these aspirations into reality. China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (also known as Sinosure), the Export-Import Bank of China, and the China Development Bank all provide export credits and, in doing so, have played central roles in helping Chinese companies gain international strength and move up global value supply chains. Through this whole-of-government approach, these Chinese entities are boosting projects throughout Asia and Africa that primarily utilize Chinese technology, engineering, and services.\n\nIn addition to the rise in export credit products and providers, exporters have reported that, today, some foreign buyers include ECA financing as a condition of a bid in their requests\n\nfor proposals (RFPs). Some RFPs not only clearly state a requirement or preference for ECA financing specifically, but also that the exporter's financing proposal is equal in importance to the technical proposal.\n\nIn the face of these changes, the U.S. export community has strongly expressed the need for a fully functioning EXIM that is empowered to level the playing field for American companies in this increasingly competitive international marketplace. In fulfilling its mission and in accordance with Charter requirements, EXIM can ensure U.S. exporters have the opportunity to win export sales, including in strategically important projects in key markets around the world, while serving as a market-oriented counterweight to China. As President Trump often says, &quot;economic security equals national security.&quot;\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOver the past two years, this Administration has ensured EXIM is adhering to its statutory mandates and has addressed and closed many recommendations from the Office of the Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office, elevated its deterrent efforts to stop third parties seeking to defraud the U.S. Government, and improved the data analytics and risk management of its portfolio.\n\nEXIM has demonstrated responsible portfolio management, with an average default rate of less than half of a percent over the past decade—a period of significant market turbulence, including the global financial crisis and the European debt crisis. As I previously underscored, since 1992, EXIM has generated $9.6 billion after covering its administrative and program expenses and setting aside reserves.\n\nEXIM has enabled thousands of businesses across the country to pursue new opportunities in reaching customers around the world. As we all know, 95 percent of potential customers are outside of the U.S. Yet, today, it is estimated that fewer than 1 percent of America's 30 million small businesses export. Many of those exporters only export to one country.\n\nTo remain truly competitive in today's global markets, we have to do better. EXIM must work with its partners at the federal, state, and local levels to provide coordinated support for U.S. businesses that have the potential to tap new markets but cannot access adequate commercial financing. While the largest transactions may receive the most attention, EXIM cannot lose sight of the critical role that small and medium-sized businesses play in communities across this country.\n\nOver the course of the past four years, export credit agencies report that they are using the availability of export credit financing to entice U.S. businesses to shift their supply chains outside of the United States and increase the foreign content of their exports. These efforts might potentially negatively affect the largest U.S. exporters as well as the thousands of small- and medium-sized American businesses, as well as many American workers throughout our nation, that make up their supply chains.\n\nI look forward to working closely with Congress on how the U.S. can best combat the aggressive tactics of foreign ECAs, provide certainty to U.S. exporters and the thousands of companies that make up their supply chains, and help more businesses grow their global market share and support U.S. workers.\n\nIn closing, I again want to thank President Trump for his support of EXIM and me. On May 30, I was fortunate enough to have a ceremonial swearing-in at the Oval Office—and while I was there, the President asked me to &quot;do great things.&quot; He asked me to &quot;fight to give American workers a level playing field and to expand foreign markets for American-Made goods&quot; and reinvigorate EXIM to &quot;help create even more great-paying jobs.&quot; That is exactly what I intend to do: transform EXIM to deliver results for America's workers and businesses, while also protecting the United States taxpayer.\n\nThe President also said that the world needs to &quot;see more products stamped with those four beautiful words: MADE IN THE USA.&quot; Now, more than ever, our nation and our workers need the United States Congress to reauthorize EXIM to help make this happen, and I stand ready to assist you in this process.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to testify and I look forward to your questions.\n\nBiography of Kimberly Reed\nPresident and Chairman of the Board of Directors\nExport-Import Bank of the United States\n\nKimberly A.

Funding your business is one of the first — and most important — financial choices most business owners make. How you choose to fund your business could affect how you structure and run your business.\n\nContent\n\nDetermine how much funding you'll need\n\nEvery business has different needs, and no financial solution is one-size-fits-all. Your personal financial situation and vision for your business will shape the financial future of your business.\n\nOnce you know how much startup funding you’ll need, it’s time to figure out how you’ll get it.\n\nSelf-funding\n\nInvestors\n\nLoans\n\nFund your business yourself with self-funding\n\nOtherwise known as bootstrapping, self-funding lets you leverage your own financial resources to support your business. Self-funding can come in the form of turning to family and friends for capital, using your savings accounts, or even tapping into your 401(k).\n\nWith self-funding, you retain complete control over the business, but you also take on all the risk yourself. Be careful not to spend more than you can afford, and be especially careful if you choose to tap into retirement accounts early. You might face expensive fees or penalties, or damage your ability to retire on time — so you should check with your plan’s administrator and a personal financial advisor first.\n\nGet venture capital from investors\n\nInvestors can give you funding to start your business in the form of venture capital investments. Venture capital is normally offered in exchange for an ownership share and active role in the company.\n\nVenture capital differs from traditional financing in a number of important ways. Venture capital typically:\n\nFocuses high-growth companies\n\nInvests capital in return for equity, rather than debt (it’s not a loan)\n\nTakes higher risks in exchange for potential higher returns\n\nHas a longer investment horizon than traditional financing\n\nAlmost all venture capitalists will, at a minimum, want a seat on the board of directors. So be prepared to give up some portion of both control and ownership of your company in exchange for funding.\n\nHow to get venture capital funding\n\nThere’s no guaranteed way to get venture capital, but the process generally follows a standard order of basic steps.\n\nFind an investor \nLook for individual investors — sometimes called “angel investors” — or venture capital firms. Be sure to do enough background research to know if the investor is reputable and has experience working with startup companies.\n\nShare your business plan \nThe investor will review your business plan to make sure it meets their investing criteria. Most investment funds concentrate on an industry, geographic area, or stage of business development.\n\nGo through due diligence review \nThe investors will look at your company’s management team, market, products and services, corporate governance documents, and financial statements.\n\nWork out the terms \nIf they want to invest, the next step is to agree on a term sheet that describes the terms and conditions for the fund to make an investment.\n\nInvestment\nOnce you agree on a term sheet, you can get the investment! Once a venture fund has invested, it becomes actively involved in the company. Venture funds normally come in “rounds.” As the company meets milestones, further rounds of financing are made available, with adjustments in price as the company executes its plan.\n\nNo treasure map necessary\n\n        When John and Kelly didn’t have enough money to open their auto repair shop, they got an SBA-backed loan to help start their business.\n\nJohn and Kelly calculate their startup costs to figure out how much funding they need to get their auto repair shop off the ground.\n\nThey can afford to pay for some of the startup costs themselves. The self-funding effort has limits, however, as they don’t want to draw from their retirement accounts.\n\nAfter speaking to a financial advisor and finding they're still 60 percent short of their funding goal, John and Kelly look for investment capital. They contact several firms, eventually getting a meeting to present their business plan.\n\nOne investment firm offers 20 percent of their funding goal in exchange for part ownership of the company. John and Kelly secure another 10 percent by starting a crowdfunding page online. Many residents are eager to have an auto repair shop in town, and they visit the site to donate.\n\nBut John and Kelly are still 30 percent short of their funding goal. Many investors and banks have not invested because they think there’s too much risk involved. Then John and Kelly learn about SBA-backed loans and get the money they need by connecting with lenders through the SBA's Lender Match tool.\n\nSBA's loan guarantee provides incentive for these lenders to do business with John and Kelly.\n\nUse crowdfunding to fund your business\n\nCrowdfunding raises funds for a business from a large number of people, called crowdfunders. Crowdfunders aren’t technically investors, because they don’t receive a share of ownership in the business and don’t expect a financial return on their money.\n\nInstead, crowdfunders expect to get a “gift” from your company as thanks for their contribution. Often, that gift is the product you plan to sell or other special perks, like meeting the business owner or getting their name in the credits. This makes crowdfunding a popular option for people who want to produce creative works (like a documentary), or a physical product (like a high-tech cooler).\n\nCrowdfunding is also popular because it’s very low risk for business owners. Not only do you get to retain full control of your company, but if your plan fails, you’re typically under no obligation to repay your crowdfunders. Every crowdfunding platform is different, so make sure to read the fine print and understand your full financial and legal obligations.\n\nGet a small business loan\n\nIf you want to retain complete control of your business, but don’t have enough funds to start, consider a small business loan.\n\nTo increase your chances of securing a loan, you should have a business plan, expense sheet, and financial projections for the next five years. These tools will give you an idea of how much you'll need to ask for, and will help the bank know they’re making a smart choice by giving you a loan.\n\nOnce you have your materials ready, contact banks and credit unions to request a loan. You’ll want to compare offers to get the best possible terms for your loan.\n\nUse Lender Match to find lenders who offer SBA-guaranteed loans \n\nIf you have trouble getting a traditional business loan, you should look into SBA-guaranteed loans. When a bank thinks your business is too risky to lend money to, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) can agree to guarantee your loan. That way, the bank has less risk and is more willing to give your business a loan.\n\nUse Lender Match to find lenders who offer SBA-guaranteed loans.\n\nSBA investment programs\n\nSmall Business Investment Company (SBIC)\n\nSBICs are privately owned and managed investment funds licensed and regulated by SBA. They use their own capital, plus funds borrowed with an SBA guarantee, to make equity and debt investments in qualifying small businesses. Learn more about SBICs to see if your business might qualify.\n\nSmall Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program\n\nThis program encourages small businesses to engage in federal research and development that has the potential for commercialization. Find out if the SBIR’s competitive awards-based program makes sense for you.\n\nSmall Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program\n\nThis program offers funding opportunities in the federal innovation research and development arena. Small businesses who qualify for this program work with nonprofit research institutions in the early and intermediate stages of starting up. Find out if the STTR program makes sense for your business.\n\nNeed help?

Self-funding can come in the form of turning to family and friends for capital, using your savings accounts, or even tapping into your 401(k).\n\nWith self-funding, you retain complete control over the business, but you also take on all the risk yourself. Be careful not to spend more than you can afford, and be especially careful if you choose to tap into retirement accounts early. You might face expensive fees or penalties, or damage your ability to retire on time — so you should check with your plan’s administrator and a personal financial advisor first.\n\nGet venture capital from investors\n\nInvestors can give you funding to start your business in the form of venture capital investments. Venture capital is normally offered in exchange for an ownership share and active role in the company.\n\nVenture capital differs from traditional financing in a number of important ways. Venture capital typically:\n\nFocuses high-growth companies\n\nInvests capital in return for equity, rather than debt (it’s not a loan)\n\nTakes higher risks in exchange for potential higher returns\n\nHas a longer investment horizon than traditional financing\n\nAlmost all venture capitalists will, at a minimum, want a seat on the board of directors. So be prepared to give up some portion of both control and ownership of your company in exchange for funding.\n\nHow to get venture capital funding\n\nThere’s no guaranteed way to get venture capital, but the process generally follows a standard order of basic steps.\n\nFind an investor \nLook for individual investors — sometimes called “angel investors” — or venture capital firms. Be sure to do enough background research to know if the investor is reputable and has experience working with startup companies.\n\nShare your business plan \nThe investor will review your business plan to make sure it meets their investing criteria. Most investment funds concentrate on an industry, geographic area, or stage of business development.\n\nGo through due diligence review \nThe investors will look at your company’s management team, market, products and services, corporate governance documents, and financial statements.\n\nWork out the terms \nIf they want to invest, the next step is to agree on a term sheet that describes the terms and conditions for the fund to make an investment.\n\nInvestment\nOnce you agree on a term sheet, you can get the investment! Once a venture fund has invested, it becomes actively involved in the company. Venture funds normally come in “rounds.” As the company meets milestones, further rounds of financing are made available, with adjustments in price as the company executes its plan.\n\nNo treasure map necessary\n\n        When John and Kelly didn’t have enough money to open their auto repair shop, they got an SBA-backed loan to help start their business.\n\nJohn and Kelly calculate their startup costs to figure out how much funding they need to get their auto repair shop off the ground.\n\nThey can afford to pay for some of the startup costs themselves. The self-funding effort has limits, however, as they don’t want to draw from their retirement accounts.\n\nAfter speaking to a financial advisor and finding they're still 60 percent short of their funding goal, John and Kelly look for investment capital. They contact several firms, eventually getting a meeting to present their business plan.\n\nOne investment firm offers 20 percent of their funding goal in exchange for part ownership of the company. John and Kelly secure another 10 percent by starting a crowdfunding page online. Many residents are eager to have an auto repair shop in town, and they visit the site to donate.\n\nBut John and Kelly are still 30 percent short of their funding goal. Many investors and banks have not invested because they think there’s too much risk involved. Then John and Kelly learn about SBA-backed loans and get the money they need by connecting with lenders through the SBA's Lender Match tool.\n\nSBA's loan guarantee provides incentive for these lenders to do business with John and Kelly.\n\nUse crowdfunding to fund your business\n\nCrowdfunding raises funds for a business from a large number of people, called crowdfunders. Crowdfunders aren’t technically investors, because they don’t receive a share of ownership in the business and don’t expect a financial return on their money.\n\nInstead, crowdfunders expect to get a “gift” from your company as thanks for their contribution. Often, that gift is the product you plan to sell or other special perks, like meeting the business owner or getting their name in the credits. This makes crowdfunding a popular option for people who want to produce creative works (like a documentary), or a physical product (like a high-tech cooler).\n\nCrowdfunding is also popular because it’s very low risk for business owners. Not only do you get to retain full control of your company, but if your plan fails, you’re typically under no obligation to repay your crowdfunders. Every crowdfunding platform is different, so make sure to read the fine print and understand your full financial and legal obligations.\n\nGet a small business loan\n\nIf you want to retain complete control of your business, but don’t have enough funds to start, consider a small business loan.\n\nTo increase your chances of securing a loan, you should have a business plan, expense sheet, and financial projections for the next five years. These tools will give you an idea of how much you'll need to ask for, and will help the bank know they’re making a smart choice by giving you a loan.\n\nOnce you have your materials ready, contact banks and credit unions to request a loan. You’ll want to compare offers to get the best possible terms for your loan.\n\nUse Lender Match to find lenders who offer SBA-guaranteed loans \n\nIf you have trouble getting a traditional business loan, you should look into SBA-guaranteed loans. When a bank thinks your business is too risky to lend money to, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) can agree to guarantee your loan. That way, the bank has less risk and is more willing to give your business a loan.\n\nUse Lender Match to find lenders who offer SBA-guaranteed loans.\n\nSBA investment programs\n\nSmall Business Investment Company (SBIC)\n\nSBICs are privately owned and managed investment funds licensed and regulated by SBA. They use their own capital, plus funds borrowed with an SBA guarantee, to make equity and debt investments in qualifying small businesses. Learn more about SBICs to see if your business might qualify.\n\nSmall Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program\n\nThis program encourages small businesses to engage in federal research and development that has the potential for commercialization. Find out if the SBIR’s competitive awards-based program makes sense for you.\n\nSmall Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program\n\nThis program offers funding opportunities in the federal innovation research and development arena. Small businesses who qualify for this program work with nonprofit research institutions in the early and intermediate stages of starting up. Find out if the STTR program makes sense for your business.\n\nNeed help?

You should choose a business structure that gives you the right balance of legal protections and benefits.\n\nContent\n\nYour business structure affects how much you pay in taxes, your ability to raise money, the paperwork you need to file, and your personal liability. \n\nYou'll need to choose a business structure before you register your business with the state. Most businesses will also need to get a tax ID number and file for the appropriate licenses and permits.\n\nChoose carefully. While you may convert to a different business structure in the future, there may be restrictions based on your location. This could also result in tax consequences and unintended dissolution, among other complications. \n\nConsulting with business counselors, attorneys, and accountants can prove helpful.\n\nReview common business structures\n\nSole proprietorship\n\nA sole proprietorship is easy to form and gives you complete control of your business. You're automatically considered to be a sole proprietorship if you do business activities but don't register as any other kind of business. \n\nSole proprietorships do not produce a separate business entity. This means your business assets and liabilities are not separate from your personal assets and liabilities. You can be held personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. Sole proprietors are still able to get a trade name. It can also be hard to raise money because you can't sell stock, and banks are hesitant to lend to sole proprietorships.\n\nSole proprietorships can be a good choice for low-risk businesses and owners who want to test their business idea before forming a more formal business.\n\nPartnership\n\nPartnerships are the simplest structure for two or more people to own a business together. There are two common kinds of partnerships: limited partnerships (LP) and limited liability partnerships (LLP).\n\nLimited partnerships have only one general partner with unlimited liability, and all other partners have limited liability. The partners with limited liability also tend to have limited control over the company, which is documented in a partnership agreement. Profits are passed through to personal tax returns, and the general partner — the partner without limited liability — must also pay self-employment taxes.\n\nLimited liability partnerships are similar to limited partnerships, but give limited liability to every owner. An LLP protects each partner from debts against the partnership, they won't be responsible for the actions of other partners. \n\nPartnerships can be a good choice for businesses with multiple owners, professional groups (like attorneys), and groups who want to test their business idea before forming a more formal business.\n\nLimited liability company (LLC) \n\nAn LLC lets you take advantage of the benefits of both the corporation and partnership business structures.\n\nLLCs protect you from personal liability in most instances, your personal assets — like your vehicle, house, and savings accounts — won't be at risk in case your LLC faces bankruptcy or lawsuits.\n\nProfits and losses can get passed through to your personal income without facing corporate taxes. However, members of an LLC are considered self-employed and must pay self-employment tax contributions towards Medicare and Social Security.\n\nLLCs can have a limited life in many states. When a member joins or leaves an LLC, some states may require the LLC to be dissolved and re-formed with new membership — unless there's already an agreement in place within the LLC for buying, selling, and transferring ownership.\n\nLLCs can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, owners with significant personal assets they want protected, and owners who want to pay a lower tax rate than they would with a corporation.\n\nCorporation\n\nC corp\n\nA corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable.\n\nCorporations offer the strongest protection to its owners from personal liability, but the cost to form a corporation is higher than other structures. Corporations also require more extensive record-keeping, operational processes, and reporting.\n\nUnlike sole proprietors, partnerships, and LLCs, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporate profits are taxed twice — first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns.\n\nCorporations have a completely independent life separate from its shareholders. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the C corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.\n\nCorporations have an advantage when it comes to raising capital because they can raise funds through the sale of stock, which can also be a benefit in attracting employees.\n\nCorporations can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, those that need to raise money, and businesses that plan to &quot;go public&quot; or eventually be sold.\n\nS corp\n\nAn S corporation, sometimes called an S corp, is a special type of corporation that's designed to avoid the double taxation drawback of regular C corps. S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates.\n\nNot all states tax S corps equally, but most recognize them the same way the federal government does and tax the shareholders accordingly. Some states tax S corps on profits above a specified limit and other states don't recognize the S corp election at all, simply treating the business as a C corp.\n\nS corps must file with the IRS to get S corp status, a different process from registering with their state.\n\nThere are special limits on S corps. Check the IRS website for eligibility requirements. You'll still have to follow the strict filing and operational processes of a C corp.\n\nS corps also have an independent life, just like C corps. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the S corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.\n\nS corps can be a good choice for a businesses that would otherwise be a C corp, but meet the criteria to file as an S corp.\n\nBenefit corporation\n\nA benefit corporation is a for-profit corporation recognized by a majority of U.S. states. Benefit corporations are different from C corps in purpose, accountability, and transparency, but aren't different in how they're taxed.\n\nBenefit corporations are driven by both mission and profit. Shareholders hold the company accountable to produce some sort of public benefit in addition to a financial profit. Some states require benefit corporations to submit annual benefit reports that demonstrate their contribution to the public good.\n\nThere are several third-party benefit corporation certification services, but none are required for a company to be legally considered one in a state where the legal status is available.\n\nClose corporation\n\nClose corporations resemble B corps but have a less traditional corporate structure. These shed many formalities that typically govern corporations and apply to smaller companies. \n\nState rules vary, but shares are usually barred from public trading. Close corporations can be run by a small group of shareholders without a board of directors.\n\nNonprofit corporation\n\nNonprofit corporations are organized to do charity, education, religious, literary, or scientific work. Because their work benefits the public, nonprofits can receive tax-exempt status, meaning they don't pay state or federal income taxes on any profits it makes.\n\nNonprofits must file with the IRS to get tax exemption, a different process from registering with their state.\n\nNonprofit corporations need to follow organizational rules very similar to a regular C corp. They also need to follow special rules about what they do with any profits they earn. For example, they can't distribute profits to members or political campaigns.\n\nNonprofits are often called 501(c)(3) corporations — a reference to the section of the Internal Revenue Code that is most commonly used to grant tax-exempt status.\n\nCooperative\n\nA cooperative is a business or organization owned by and operated for the benefit of those using its services. Profits and earnings generated by the cooperative are distributed among the members, also known as user-owners. Typically, an elected board of directors and officers run the cooperative while regular members have voting power to control the direction of the cooperative. Members can become part of the cooperative by purchasing shares, though the amount of shares they hold does not affect the weight of their vote.\n\nCombine different business structures\n\nDesignations like S corp and nonprofit aren't strictly business structures — they can also be understood as a tax status. It's possible for an LLC to be taxed as a C corp, S corp, or a nonprofit. These arrangements are far less common and can be more difficult to set up. If you're considering one of these non-standard structures, you should speak with a business counselor or an attorney to help you decide.\n\nCompare business structures\n\nCompare the general traits of these business structures, but remember that ownership rules, liability, taxes, and filing requirements for each business structure can vary by state. The following table is intended only as a guideline.

There is no current standard for defining the meaning of the data that swap dealers are required to report to SDRs. This lack of standards inhibits the CFTC and SEC from validating and normalizing data across SDRs and across geography, standardizing product identification, consistently aggregating and classifying instruments, aligning reports using various messaging schemas and supporting complex analytics based on ad-hoc scenarios. The pathway to addressing this challenge is aligned with the DTS financial instrument database recommendation and it makes sense to start the process of developing the financial instrument database in conjunction with the immediate requirements of the CFTC\n                and SEC for reporting OTC derivative contracts to SDRs.\n\n              \nBackground\n\n              \nThe Office of Financial Research (OFR) is directed to implement regulations to standardize the types and formats of data reported and collected on behalf of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) standard was a clear illustration of how the data standardization objective can be implemented and extended. One of the objectives of the Data &amp; Technology Subcommittee (DTS) is to work with the OFR to establish an operational route map on the other core standards needed to support the FSOC and member agencies.\n\n              \nDTS has created a Standardization Working Group to assess the analytical objectives of FSOC (in cooperation with the Risk and Research Subcommittees of FRAC) and translate them into specific standards priorities. The range of standards needed to meet these objectives is broad ranging from standards for loans and loan portfolios to classification to multi-listed instrument identification to derivatives transparency reporting. DTS views the full spectrum of standards as important factors of input for OFR to consider, but concludes that the most immediate problem should be to work with the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) to develop standards for reporting OTC derivative contracts to swap data repositories (SDRs).\n\n              \nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (DFA) specifically requires the CFTC and the SEC to develop and enforce rules for reporting of these derivative transactions to SDRs to facilitate monitoring of market functions and to support systemic risk assessment. The CFTC and SEC have the authority under DFA to mandate detailed standards for what data should be reported as well as the format and meaning of the data, but they have not yet specified these standards. This lack of standards (both content and format) inhibits the CFTC and SEC from performing their market oversight and systemic risk analysis objectives. In particular, the lack of standards makes accurate aggregation and complex analytics very difficult because the critical contractual terms are not reported based on a common set of concepts and definitions.\n\n              \nThe pathway to addressing this challenge is very much in alignment with the DTS recommendation on the OFR’s obligation to publish a financial instrument database. In this areas of objectives the SEC, CFTC and OFR are closely aligned. The CFTC and SEC need to develop detailed standards for reporting on a specific set of contracts. The OFR needs to develop the concepts, definitions and business relationships (i.e. the contractual ontology) associated with all financial instrument types.\n\n              \nDTS believes that it makes sense for OFR to start the process of developing its financial instrument database by working with the CFTC and SEC to develop the ontology for reporting OTC derivative contracts to SDRs. It is worth noting that this is very similar to the approach that led to the LEI initiative\n\n              \n            \n\n    \n    \n\n      \n\n        \n\n          \n\n            ×\n            \nYou are now leaving the OFR’s website.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n            \nYou will be redirected to:\n\n            \nYou are now leaving the OFR Website.

(Working Paper no. 16-01)\n\n                  \n                  \nAbstract\n\n                  \nSupervisory stress testing to date has focused on the resiliency of large banks to withstand the direct effects of a credit shock. Using data from Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), we apply the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory scenarios to evaluate the default of a bank’s largest counterparty. We find that indirect effects of this default, through the bank’s other counterparties, are larger than the direct impact on the bank. Further, when taken as a whole, the core banking system has a higher concentration to a single counterparty than does any individual bank holding company. Under the 2015 stress, the banking system’s counterparty credit concentration is high and corresponds in diversity to a market with just over three firms. Our results are the first to evaluate the credit derivatives market under stress and also underscore the importance of a macroprudential perspective on stress testing.\n\n                  \nKeywords: Credit default swaps, stress testing, systemic risk, financial networks, counterparty exposure, contagion \n\n                    JEL Classification Numbers: D85, G01, G13, G20, L14\n                  \n\n                \n\n              \n\n              \n\n                \n\n                     Back to Working Papers\n                  \n\n              \n\n            \n\n      \n      \n\n    \n    \n\n      \n\n        \n\n          \n\n            ×\n            \nYou are now leaving the OFR’s website.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n            \nYou will be redirected to:\n\n            \nYou are now leaving the OFR Website.

Using supervisory data, the authors find that a fund’s relative and absolute performance influence a manager’s behavior and the future risks they take. The analysis considers how hedge fund characteristics like redemption policies and ownership structure affect the way managers respond to underperformance and how their investment strategies can amplify portfolio volatility as they attempt to achieve higher returns (Working Paper no. 24-07).\n\n                  \nAbstract\n\n                  \nGiven the emergence of hedge funds as large intermediaries whose risk-taking affects financial markets, we investigate whether compensation incentives distort the risk choices of fund managers. Using confidential supervisory data on hedge fund returns and characteristics, we fnd strong evidence of risk-shifting behavior consistent with managers attempting to meet performance benchmarks and maximize investor flows. Both the best- and worst-performing funds increase portfolio volatility relative to their peers, as do those below their high-water marks. Funds with permissive redemption policies and those with concentrated ownership risk shift most aggressively. Laggard managers amplify volatility by increasing leverage and modifying asset class allocations, while top performers instead pursue contrarian strategies.\n\n                  \nView related blog\n\n                \n\n              \n\n              \n\n                \n\n                     Back to Working Papers\n                  \n\n              \n\n            \n\n      \n      \n\n    \n    \n\n      \n\n        \n\n          \n\n            ×\n            \nYou are now leaving the OFR’s website.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n            \nYou will be redirected to:\n\n            \nYou are now leaving the OFR Website.

When we do, we create opportunity and prosperity for millions of Americans,” said Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe historic Investing in America agenda has spurred a factory building boom that will rely on diverse suppliers for continued success. The construction of manufacturing facilities contributed more to real gross domestic product in the first six months of this year than any other six-month period on record. And, last year’s foreign direct investment in new U.S. manufacturing facilities was almost double the pre-pandemic average.\n\nIt is important that the benefits of this economic opportunity are shared equitably. Diversification of suppliers—in manufacturing, construction, and related services—ensures that the country’s supply chain is more resilient and that the economy benefits from the talent and potential across the country. Considering diverse suppliers are often small- and medium-sized businesses, their equitable participation in the Investing in America agenda will provide a path to economic prosperity and intergenerational wealth for countless Americans in underserved communities.\n\nThat is why the Administration has awarded a record-breaking nearly $70 billion in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022—a new record—on federal contracts awarded to small, disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). And it has invested $12 billion in community lenders—including Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) – to expand access to capital and resources to too-often sidelined entrepreneurs.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Treasury estimates that these investments in community lenders will result in a $50 billion increase in lending to Latino communities and a nearly $80 billion increase in lending to Black communities over the next decade. One-third of new loans made by CDFIs and MDIs that received investments under the Department of Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program were made to most in need borrowers, such as individuals who are low-income or live on Tribal lands. In parallel, the Small Business Administration has increased its lending to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, which has helped to more than double the amount of loans to Black-owned businesses and double the number of loans to Latino-owned businesses. Now, Black and Latino entrepreneurs are starting new businesses at the fastest rates in more than a decade while Black and Latino unemployment rates are near historic lows.\n\nToday’s announcements coincide with the annual Freedman’s Bank Forum, hosted at the Department of Treasury. They represent commitments from the private, public, and non-profit sectors that will continue to accelerate wealth-building for underserved businesses, their communities, and the American economy.\n\nPrivate sector and philanthropic commitments to support underserved communities:\n\nA call to action to bring underserved communities and businesses into domestic supply chains: Vice President Harris is calling on companies in Investing in America sectors—semiconductor manufacturing, clean energy manufacturing, transportation, heavy industry, and biomanufacturing—to strengthen and diversify domestic supply chains by committing at least 15% of their U.S.-based contract spending on outside goods and services from small and underserved businesses by 2025. Alongside these increased contracting goals, the Administration is calling on companies to provide technical assistance for underserved entrepreneurs in these growing high value-added sectors, and commit to disaggregated data reporting of commitments. Micron, Xcel Energy, and Air Products have made commitments as first movers under the Economic Opportunity Coalition (EOC) – a coordinated set of companies aligning major investments in underserved communities with investments made by the Biden-Harris Administration. These companies represent billions of dollars in spending in these growing sectors, and additional companies are encouraged to step forward to join them.\n\nA new $3 billion goal to increase corporate deposits into community finance institutions after surpassing $1 billion. The EOC is announcing an ambitious goal to reach $3 billion in committed deposits to CDFIs and MDIs. In June, the EOC announced that it had reached a milestone of over $1 billion in deposit commitments by EOC members. With today’s announcement, the EOC is signaling its continued dedication to this work by raising an additional $2 billion for community lenders by next Freedman’s Bank Forum, which would bring their total commitment to $3 billion.\n\n$75 million committed to connect rural communities to opportunities in the Investing in America agenda. Heartland Fund is launching Resource Rural (RR), a new program to ensure rural people and communities realize local benefits from federal funding for historic climate, energy and infrastructure investments. Resource Rural is an ambitious $75M, five-year program designed to build engagement, capacity and expertise, share success stories, and ensure rural voices are represented in national efforts focused on climate and energy progress, workforce development, and equitable community and economic development\n\nLaunch of $80 million investment fund to bridge small businesses to capital access programs. The Initiative for Inclusive Entrepreneurship (IIE), which was announced at the 2022 Freedman’s Bank Forum, is launching an investment fund to leverage $80 million in private and philanthropic capital to help the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) expand access to capital for underserved small businesses. This investment strategy is led by Hyphen, Mission Driven Finance, and JumpStart. Others leading implementation of IIE’s capacity-building pilot include Founders First Capital Partners, Next Street, and Nowak Metro Finance Lab.\n\nCatalyzing Partnerships for the Low-Income Communities to Access Inflation Reduction Act Credit Programs: Accelerating Community Investments (ACI), an initiative of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, is partnering with What Works Plus, to mobilize private and nonprofit leaders to support equitable implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, Treasury’s Low-Income Community Bonus Credit Program will drive thousands of cost-saving clean energy investments in low-income communities, on Indian land, as part of affordable housing developments, and benefit low-income households. The initiative will aim to maximize adoption of the program by public, nonprofit, and mission-driven private actors in clean energy, affordable housing, and community economic development. And in the process, increase the potential for inclusive local business development and job opportunities that future projects create.\n\nLeveraging federal investments and purchasing power to expand opportunity for underserved small businesses:\n\nNew commitments to expand capital access to very small and historically underserved businesses. Treasury is releasing a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the new $75 million Investing in America Small Business Opportunity Program, a competitive grant program under the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to support technical assistance for very small and underserved businesses. Treasury is encouraging States, territories, D.C., and Tribal governments to apply for funding, with an emphasis on supporting businesses that need financing or other support to help them benefit from the historic investments made by the President’s Investing in America agenda, including public and private infrastructure project opportunities, and participation in critical manufacturing supply chains and the clean energy transition. This builds upon the $325 million in SSBCI funding previously announced to support technical assistance delivered through the SSBCI Technical Assistance Grant program and Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) Capital Readiness Grant program.\n\nNew federal goal to increase contract opportunities for SDBs. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will set, via an Office of Management and Budget memorandum to agencies, an interim goal of awarding 13% of federal contract spending to SDBs for FY 2024. This memo directs federal agencies to work with the Small Business Administration (SBA) on agency-specific goals in support of the federal government’s overall goal. MBDA’s Federal Procurement Center will support this goal through capacity building and information sharing to minority-owned businesses that want to access federal contracts. Shortly after taking office, President Biden set a goal of increasing the share of contracts with SDBs to 15% of all federal contracts by FY 2025, a 50% increase from spending levels when he first took office. The U.S. government buys about $650 billion in goods and services each year, making it the largest purchaser in the country. That spending power is a powerful tool for supporting small business growth.\n\nThese new capital announcements follow recent announcements across the U.S. government to support equal opportunity and equitable access to capital, investment, and quality jobs in the President’s Investing in America agenda. These include:\n\nOver $20 million available to empower under-resourced communities to access historic infrastructure spending. The Department of Transportation has announced its 2023 Thriving Communities Program, in which up to $22 million will be available to support communities that lack the staffing, technical expertise to scope, fund, and develop infrastructure projects that advance local development. The notice of funding opportunity closes on November 28, 2023. A Call for Letters of Interest (LOI) is also posted; the portal to submit a letter closes on November 15, 2023.\n\nHistoric funding for clean energy deployment and pollution reduction in disadvantaged communities. On October 12, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) closed its application window for the historic $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), which will mobilize financing and private capital for clean energy projects and build the capacity of community lenders working in low-income and disadvantaged communities. EPA will soon announce a $2 billion Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants competition, which will invest in projects that are led by community-based organizations to reduce pollution, build climate resilience, and support economic prosperity in communities overburdened by environmental justice challenges. In coordination with DOT’s Thriving Communities Program, and in partnership with the Department of Energy, EPA has awarded $177 million in funding to 16 Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers that will provide support to communities across the country to access federal resources.\n\nRemoving barriers to government-backed loans for entrepreneurs. In September, the SBA proposed a rule that would help expand access to SBA loan programs for people with certain criminal history records . One in three American adults has a criminal record, and these people identify employment as their most urgent need, but most significant obstacle. Once finalized, the proposed rule would expand access to capital for entrepreneurs with certain criminal records by expanding eligibility and removing barriers to SBA’s loan and surety bond programs.\n\nProviding opportunities to easily increase lending to underserved businesses. On May 12, 2023, SBA initiated a program to enable Community Advantage Pilot Program Lenders to become Small Business Lending Companies (SBLCs). The pilot loan program assists small business borrowers in underserved markets who have historically been excluded from conventional business financing due to systemic barriers, among other factors. SBA transitioned a total of 143 Pilot Lenders to SBLCs. The Community Advantage lenders that transitioned to SBLC status account for 99.8% of the total Community Advantage loan portfolio. In FY 23, Community Advantage lenders grew their SBA lending by 23% compared to FY22 for a total of $141.3 million for nearly 800 small businesses — demonstrating the impact of expanding capital access in underserved communities.\n\nAwarding energy innovators in underserved communities. The Department of Energy’s (DOE) Inclusive Energy Innovation Prize, which supports clean energy innovation efforts in underserved communities, made $1.5 million in awards to winning teams in Alaska, Louisiana, New York, Oregon, Puerto Rico, and Washington this year. The award winners received $250,000 respectively for workforce development efforts, entrepreneurship, and relevant efforts to support the clean energy transition. This program is a key part of the Department’s commitment to the Justice40 initiative, where 40% of overall benefits from federal investments in clean energy flow to disadvantaged communities.\n\nConnecting minority-owned businesses to the federal innovation ecosystem. The DOE and U.S. Patent and Trade Office (PTO) announced a new commitment to ensure minority-owned businesses can navigate the innovation ecosystem more effectively. Their work will promote technical assistance and education, and promote data-driven policies in support of improving the United States’ energy supply chain. The Department of Energy and U.S. PTO will share and leverage resources to improve minority businesses’ access to the energy industries and their subsectors.\n\nExpanded federal coordination on community investments with climate and clean energy programs. Community voices requested an expansion of the agencies participating in the Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC) to account for the Administration’s historic climate and environmental programs. Based on this feedback, the EPA and DOE joined the ICIC in July. Their representation on the Committee will improve coordination of federal community investment programs and increase the flow of resources to underserved communities under the Administration’s climate priorities. This will help guide successful implementation of historic programs such as the GGRF and maximize the positive impact for communities that have historically been left behind.\n\n###\n\nStay Connected\n\n\t\t\tSign Up\n\n\t\t\t\tEmail Address* Required\n\n\t\t\t\tZIP Code\n\n\t\t\t\tPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nShare\n\n\t\tShare this page on Facebook\n\n\t\tShare this page on X\n\n\t\thttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/25/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-new-efforts-to-expand-capital-access-and-contracting-opportunities-for-minority-owned-and-underserved-businesses-at-the-freedmans-bank-forum/?utm_source=link\n\n\t\t\tScroll to Top\n\n\t\tScroll to Top\t\n\n\t\tTop"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:47:45.448866"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2561]]

Before the legal integration of education in the 1950s and 1960s, Black students were prevented from obtaining higher education at many state and private colleges. This led to the establishment of colleges and universities with the explicit mission of educating Black students. Although the legal landscape, social fabric, and education system of the United States has changed significantly since the mid-1900s, many of the schools founded during that era to educate Black students still exist today and carry forward their rich legacy of higher education for more than 180 years as HBCUs: Congressionally defined as institutions established before 1964 with the primary mission of educating Black Americans.\n\nThis issue brief highlights a few key facts about the importance of HBCUs in the higher education and economic mobility of Black Americans and highlights historic administration actions to support them:\n\nHBCUs have long been engines of upward mobility for students who, due to systemic racism and discrimination, had limited access to other higher education options. Although they make up less than 3 percent of all postsecondary institutions in the U.S., HBCUs account for 8 percent of Black undergraduate enrollment and 13 percent of all bachelor’s degrees earned by Black students.\n\nRecent research indicates that HBCUs provide more access to higher education for lower-income students than other institutions, foster greater upward mobility than most U.S. colleges, and excel in terms of degree completion rates for students: about 30 percent of HBCU students will move up at least two income quintiles from their parents by age 30. This is nearly double that of non-HBCUs, where only 18 percent will do so.\n\nHBCUs produce all of these positive outcomes in the face of historic underfunding relative to peer institutions: both systematic underfunding via public sources such as state appropriations as well as less private funding as evidenced by smaller endowments.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has shown a historic commitment to supporting HBCUs through calls to equalize state funding, federal investments via the American Rescue Plan, and fostering a government-wide approach to uplifting HBCUs.\n\nHistory of Black Postsecondary Education in the U.S. \n\nAlthough the first recorded Black student enrolled in an American post-secondary institution enrolled at the turn of the nineteenth century, and the first bachelor’s degrees awarded to Black men and women were awarded in 1823 and 1862, respectively, educational opportunities for Black students were long suppressed. In 1837, the first HBCU was established with the express goal of educating Black Americans for gainful employment. The majority of these institutions were established in the decades immediately following the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. Until post-secondary education was legally desegregated by Brown v. Board of Education, nearly all Black students were educated at what are now known as HBCUs.\n\nToday, despite comprising a small fraction of U.S. higher education institutions, HBCUs have continued to make major contributions to the academic achievements of Black Americans. As of 2022, 99 accredited HBCUs operate across 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (Figure 1). While they accounted for just 8 percent of Black undergraduate enrollment in 2021, HBCUs conferred 13 percent of all bachelor’s degrees earned by Black students and nearly one quarter of all bachelor’s degrees earned by Black students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (NCES, 2024; George-Joseph and Kodnani, 2023).\n\nReturn on Investment at HBCUs\n\nRecent evidence shows that HBCUs’ outsized impact reflects their very large “value added”—that is, HBCUs improve student outcomes by a larger margin than many other schools.\n\nImportant early research compared those who enrolled at HBCUs and Traditionally White Institutions (TWIs) and found that HBCU matriculation was associated with higher wages and an increased probability of graduation in the 1970s, but that this was no longer the case by the 1990s. This “fading-out” of the benefits of HBCUs over time called into question the relative benefits of HBCUs in present day. Much of the older literature, however, looks only at individuals who ultimately enroll in college. In other words, previous work assumed that if a student did not attend a four-year HBCU, they would still go on to attend a four-year college or university. More recent research shows that this assumption often does not hold: there are significant numbers of Black men and women who likely would not make it to college at all absent HBCUs, casting serious doubt on the initial conclusion that HBCU may no longer confer benefits on Black students.\n\nSpecifically, Edwards et al. (2023) use a sample of over one million Black SAT takers between 2004 and 2010, and find that, because of differences in application patterns, students who apply to HBCUs are less likely than their peers to go to a four-year college without the opportunity to enroll in an HBCU. Specifically, the fallback option for students who send their SAT score to at least one HBCU is more likely to be a two-year school or no college. This shows that (a) the typical Black student who enrolls at an HBCU may be very different than one who enrolls at a non-HBCU, and (b) ignoring the role of HBCUs in promoting 4-year college enrollment may drastically understate the benefits of enrolling in an HBCU for subsequent outcomes. Using a more appropriate basis for comparison (i.e., all students who enrolled at an HBCU versus those that did not), the authors found that enrolling in an HBCU was associated with a 14.6 percentage point increase in the probability of earning a BA and 5 percent higher household income by around age 30.\n\nDue to HBCUs’ large, positive effects on enrollees, and because they are more likely than other schools, on average, to enroll students from disadvantaged backgrounds, HBCUs are powerful engines of upward social mobility. Research from Chetty et al. (2020) uses data from anonymized tax records to explore how colleges help or hinder social mobility. Among the HBCUs included in the sample (roughly half of all four-year HBCUs), about 24 percent of students at the average HBCU are from families in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution – more than twice the rate of the average four-year school.\n\nIn addition, Figure 3 shows that about 30 percent of all students in four-year HBCUs ascend two or more income quintiles between childhood and age 30. This contrasts with four-year non-HBCUs, where only 18 percent of students do the same; the share is slightly higher at public four-year institutions. If we compare HBCUs to elite, predominantly white institutions like Yale, Princeton, and Harvard, roughly 10 percent of students achieve the same mobility. This discrepancy stems from two factors: (1) elite institutions enroll fewer students who can move up two income quintiles (because they are more likely to enter in one of the top two income quintiles), and (2) HBCUs both admit a large number of students from the bottom of the income distribution and successfully move them up the income distribution, thus generating social mobility.\n\nWhat Drives This Success? \n\nSurvey research highlights that HBCUs’ unique ability to foster upward mobility may be due to higher rates of mentorship, support, and experiential learning opportunities compared to non-HBCU institutions (Price and Viceisza, 2023).  Qualitative research in sociology and psychology also finds that HBCUs are effective in cultivating a sense of belonging and a “culture of success” among students, aligning with their degree granting and graduation patterns. Beyond their excellence in educating Black students, HBCUs offer a unique space for students who have been historically excluded from predominantly white institutions. This was the founding mission of HBCUs: to educate Black students when other institutions wouldn’t. Today, despite having the choice to attend any institution, more Black students are choosing HBCUs (see Figure 4). The increase in HBCU enrollment over the last two years contrasts with the overall decline at other postsecondary institutions nationwide. Moreover, there has been a historic spike in applications to HBCUs since 2020: some HBCUs reported up to a 30 percent increase in applications between the 2019 and 2021 cycles.\n\nHistoric Underfunding of HBCUs\n\nStandard economic theory (and common sense) dictates that when particular sectors are highly productive, one should invest more heavily in these sectors. However, this has not been the case with HBCUs—which historically have been relatively underfunded. We discuss the details of this below.\n\nFirst, public HBCUs have been historically underfunded compared to their non-HBCU peers, especially those institutions that are land-grant universities. Under the Second Morrill Act of 1980, states opening a second land-grant university to serve Black students were required to provide an equitable distribution of state funds to each institution. Using data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Departments of Education and Agriculture found state-level discrepancies in per student funding that aggregate to severe financial gaps: $172 million to $2.1 billion per state between 1987 and 2020. Research finds that funding, especially at public institutions, can have significant impacts on downstream student outcomes: increases in state appropriations can reduce student debt burdens and—at the two-year level—can improve degree attainment (Chakrabarti et al, 2020) and increased spending has important, positive impacts on postsecondary enrollment, persistence, and completion (Deming and Walters, 2017).\n\nAcross both public and private institutions, HBCUs have much smaller endowments than non-HBCUs, owing in-part to historic inequities and discriminatory practices—such as redlining and blockbusting—that have led to large racial wealth gaps that can contribute to racial gaps in giving. Indeed, research shows that per full-time student, the endowment for public HBCUs was about 50 percent of the endowment for public non-HBCUs in 2021. The gap is larger at private institutions, where the average HBCU endowment per full time student is about 21 percent of non-HBCUs. Despite several high-profile private donations to HBCUs since 2020, the endowment gap has grown over time, especially recently at private institutions (Figure 5).\n\nDiscrepancies in both private and public funding leave HBCUs to be highly reliant on tuition and fees for funding. This creates a fundamental mismatch with the needs of Black students, who are more likely to come from lower-income families and need additional financial supports. These funding structures are particularly problematic in times of economic downturn; whereas other institutions are able to leverage a combination of endowments and public funding to minimize tuition increases and offset operating costs, HBCUs are left to rely more heavily on revenue from tuition and fees and may be more likely to raise tuition.\n\nAdministration Efforts \n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic action in supporting HBCUs, recognizing their high return on investment despite generations of unequal funding. In September 2023, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Education called on 16 states to rectify a $12 billion funding discrepancy between land-grant HBCUs and their non-HBCU counterparts. States have failed to fulfill their legal obligation to provide equitable funding to HBCUs for nearly four decades, and the Biden-Harris Administration has underscored the need to right these historical wrongs. The Administration has also invested over $16 billion in HBCUs through the American Rescue Plan, capital finance debt relief, grant funding to expand academic capacity, and financial aid and other educational benefits for HBCU-enrolled students and veterans.\n\nHBCUs have particularly benefited from the Administration’s higher education funding initiatives. First, although the Pell grant program is race neutral, HBCU students are more likely to meet the eligibility requirements than their non-HBCU peers, meaning that the recent $900 increase in Pell Grants, the largest in a decade, has made college more affordable for the 75 percent of HBCU students who rely on these grants. The Administration’s Saving on a Valuable Education Plan (SAVE) eases student loan repayment, which is especially important for Black students who have historically shouldered a disproportionate loan burden. An Urban Institute analysis estimates that 59 percent of credentials earned by Black students could be eligible for loan forgiveness under SAVE, compared to 42 percent for white students (Delisle and Cohn, 2023). The SAVE plan’s outsized impact on low-income borrowers makes it particularly salient for HBCUs, who enroll a disproportionate number of students from the bottom of the income distribution —allowing HBCU graduates to benefit from the upward mobility fostered by their institution without being overburdened by student debt.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has a strong record of supporting HBCUs, and has set an example across the Federal government to do the same. Other initiatives across the U.S. Air Force, the Departments of Education, Commerce, Transportation, Energy, as well as NASA and the National Science Foundation have pioneered new programs to support HBCUs since 2021. By setting an example of recognizing the achievements of HBCUs, the Administration is drawing in investment and support from all angles to lift up the unique success of HBCUs across the country.\n\nStay Connected\n\n\t\t\tSign Up\n\n\t\t\t\tEmail Address* Required\n\n\t\t\t\tZIP Code\n\n\t\t\t\tPlease leave blank.\n\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nShare\n\n\t\tShare this page on Facebook\n\n\t\tShare this page on X\n\n\t\thttps://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/05/16/the-economics-of-hbcus/?utm_source=link\n\n\t\t\tScroll to Top\n\n\t\tScroll to Top\t\n\n\t\tTop"], ["updated_at", "2024-11-05 07:47:47.423943"], ["processed", true], ["id", 2562]]
